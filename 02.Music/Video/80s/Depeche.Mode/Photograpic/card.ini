[storyline]
storyline_en = A white house, a white room\nThe program of today\nLights on, switch on\nYour eyes are far away\nThe map represents you\nAnd the tape is your voice\nFollow all along you\nTill you recognize the choice\nI take pictures\nPhotographic pictures\nBright light\nDark room\nBright light\nDark room\nI said I'd write a letter\nBut I never got the time\nAnd I'm looking to the day\nI mesmerise the light\nThe years I spend just thinking\nOf a moment we both knew\nA second boss looking into\nIt seems it can't be true

[storyline]
storyline_en = Illuminated you are\nIn hope of being spoken to\nDrawn to the helix\nThat glows before your eyes\nYes, you’re among the chosen few\n\nAnd now that the gates are open\nYou stand in radiation\n\nDistort the picture and the world for a while\nWill cease to be so upside down\nYou feel your heart is the size of the globe\nOh, you pretend you’re not alone\n\nThe flickering light with ethereal grace\nWill lift you from this place\nThat means not a thing to you\nAnd all these years you’re going through\nWill leave without a trace\nWatch out what you hold on to\n\nIlluminated you are\nIn hope of being spoken to\nAnd in the meantime\nYou wait mesmerised\nAnd force your ghosts to come for you

[storyline]
storyline_en=Between your lips\nBetween your teeth\nThere on your tongue\nIn your throat and beneath\nThis bitter taste you feel is so real\nYou beat your fist against the wall\nWhen you’re sick and tired of it all\nBut still you’re longing for more\n\nYou wish you could tear up all your scars\nHow come that you still feel so right\nYou know it’s so insane\nYou wish you forgot your nightmare hours\nBut you would want the same again\n\nIt’s time you tried to slowly calm down\nYou hear the voice is fading out\nRelease a hiss\nRelease a sigh\nLet out a cry into the night\nYou would survive but still don’t know how

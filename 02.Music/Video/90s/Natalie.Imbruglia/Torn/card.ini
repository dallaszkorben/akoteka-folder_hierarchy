[storyline]
storyline_en = I thought I saw a man brought to life\nHe was warm, he came around like he was dignified\nHe showed me what it was to cry\n\nWell, you couldn't be that man I adored\nYou don't seem to know\nSeem to care what your heart is for\nBut I don't know him anymore\n\nThere's nothing where he used to lie\nMy conversation has run dry\nThat's what's going on\nNothing's fine, I'm torn\n\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\n\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn\n\nSo I guess the fortune teller's right\nI should have seen just what was there\nAnd not some holy light\n\nBut you crawled beneath my veins\nAnd now I don't care, I have no luck\nI don't miss it all that much\nThere's just so many things\nThat I can't touch, I'm torn\n\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\n\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn, torn\n\nThere's nothing where he used to lie\nMy inspiration has run dry\nThat's what's going on\nNothing's right, I'm torn\n\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\n\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\n\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I'm ashamed\nBound and broken on the floor\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn, torn

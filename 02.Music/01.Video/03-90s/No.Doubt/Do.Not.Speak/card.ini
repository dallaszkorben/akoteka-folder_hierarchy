[lyrics]
orig = You and me\nWe used to be together\nEveryday together\nAlways\nI really feel\nThat I'm losing my best friend\nI can't believe\nThis could be the end\n\nIt looks as though you're letting go\nAnd if it's real\nWell, I don't want to know\n\nDon't speak\nI know just what you're saying\nSo please stop explaining\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts\nDon't speak\nI know what you're thinking\nI don't need your reasons\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts\n\nOur memories\nThey can be inviting\nBut some are altogether\nMighty frightening\nAs we die\nBoth you and I\nWith my head in my hands\nI sit and cry\n\nDon't speak\nI know just what you're saying\nSo please stop explaining\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts\n(No, no, no)\nDon't speak\nI know what you're thinking\nAnd I don't need your reasons\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts\n\nIt's all ending\nWe gotta stop pretending who we are\n\nYou and me\nI can see us dying\nAre we?\n\nDon't speak\nI know just what you're saying\nSo please stop explaining\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts\n(No, no)\nDon't speak\nI know what you're thinking\nAnd I don't need your reasons\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts\n\nI know what you're saying\nSo please stop explaining\nDon't speak\nDon't speak\nDon't speak, oh\n\nI know what you're thinking\nAnd I don't need your reasons\nI know you're good\nI know you're good\nI know you're real good, oh\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nDon't, don't, uh-huh\n\nHush, hush darlin'\nHush, hush darlin'\nHush, hush\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts\n\nHush, hush darlin'\nHush, hush darlin'\nHush, hush\nDon't tell me 'cause it hurts

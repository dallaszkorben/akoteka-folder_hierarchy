[lyrics]
orig = Smack, crack, bushwhacked\nTie another one to the racks, baby\nHey kids, rock and roll\nNobody tells you where to go, baby\nWhat if I ride, what if you walk?\nWhat if you rock around the clock?\nTick-tock, tick-tock\nWhat if you did, what if you walk?\nWhat if you tried to get off, baby?\nHey, kids, where are you?\nNobody tells you what to do, baby\nHey kids, shake a leg\nMaybe you're crazy in the head, baby\nMaybe you did, maybe you walked\nMaybe you rocked around the clock\nTick-tock, tick-tock\nMaybe I ride, maybe you walk\nMaybe I drive to get off, baby\nHey kids, shake a leg\nMaybe you're crazy in the head, baby\nOllie, Ollie, Ollie, Ollie, Ollie\nOllie, Ollie in come free, baby\nHey, kids, where are you?\nNobody tells you what to do, baby\nSmack, crack, shack-a-lack\nTie another one to your backs, baby\nHey kids, rock and roll\nNobody tells you where to go, baby\nMaybe you did, maybe you walk\nMaybe you rock around the clock\nTick-tock, tick-tock\nMaybe I ride, maybe you walk\nMaybe I drive to get off, baby\nHey kids, where are you?\nNobody tells you what to do, baby\nHey kids, rock and roll\nNobody tells you where to go, baby\nBaby\nBaby

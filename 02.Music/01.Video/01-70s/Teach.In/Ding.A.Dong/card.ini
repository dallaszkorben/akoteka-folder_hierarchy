orig = When you feelin' all right, everything is up-tight\nTry to sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong\nThere will be no sorrow when you sing tomorrow\nAnd you walk along with your ding-dang-dong\n\nDing-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower\nEven when your lover is gone, gone, gone\nDing-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit\nEven when your lover is gone, gone, gone\nSing ding-ding-dong\n\nWhen you feelin' all right, everything is up-tight\nListen to sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong\nAnd the world looks sunny, everyone is funny\nWhen they sing a song that goes ding-dang-dong\n\nDing-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower\nEven when your lover is gone, gone, gone\nDing-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit\nEven when your lover is gone, gone, gone\nSing ding-ding-dong\n\n(Ding-dang-dong, ding-a-dang-dong)\nWhen you think it's all over, they let me down\nDry your tears and forget all your sorrow\nTry to smile while you say goodbye\n(Ding-dong ding-dong)\nDing-dang-dong when you'll wake up tomorrow\nWhen the sun is up in the sky\n\nWhen you feelin' all right, everything is up-tight\nTry to sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong\nThere will be no sorrow when you'll sing tomorrow\nAnd you walk along with your ding-dang-dong\n\nDing-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower\nEven when your lover is gone, gone, gone\nDing-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit\nEven when your lover is gone, gone, gone\n\nDing-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower\nEven when your lover is gone, gone, gone\nDing-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it's a big hit\nEven when your lover is gone, gone, gone\nnSing ding-ding-dong

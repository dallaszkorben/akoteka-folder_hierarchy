[lyrics]
orig = So many destination faces going to so many places\nWhere the weather is much better\nAnd the food is so much cheaper.\nWell I help her with her baggage for her baggage is so heavy\nI hear the plane is ready by the gateway to take my love away.\nAnd I can't believe that she really wants to leave me and it's getting me so,\nIt's getting me so.\n\nAirport -\nAirport, you've got a smiling face,\nyou took the one I love so far away\nFly her away - fly her away - airport.\nAirport, you've got a smiling face\nYou took my lady to another place\nFly her away - fly her away.\n\nThe plane is on the move,\nAnd the traces of the love we had in places\nAre turning in my mind - how I wish I'd been much stronger\nFor the wheels are turning faster as I hear the winds are blowing\nand I know that she is leaving\nOn the jet plane way down the runaway.\nAnd I can't believe that she really wants to leave me - and it's\ngetting me so,\nIt's getting me so.\n\nAirport -\nAirport, you've got a smiling face,...\n\nAirport -\nAirport, you've got a smiling face,...

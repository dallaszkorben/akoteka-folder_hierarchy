orig = Fly with the clouds from the wind\nIn the desert there's a sandstorm\nDust in my eyes, in my ears\nThere's a rumour of a sandstorm\nMoments of a fear drawing near\nGive me shelter from the sandstorm\nSandstorm\n\nSee how the sun's burning eye\nIn the sky closes tight\nBringing night while we wait\nIn the gloom for the sandstorm\n\nFall to the ground all around\nThere's a wind blowing sand\nRaise your hand to your face\nBut you can't stop the sandstorm\n\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\n\nNowhere to run or to hide\nFrom the fury of the sandstorm (sandstorm)\nNo one can say how much time\nWe must suffer in the sandstorm (sandstorm)\nEach of us stands here alone\nAt the mercy of the sandstorm (sandstorm)\nSandstorm\n\nSee how the sun's burning eye\nIn the sky closes tight\nBringing night while we wait\nIn the gloom for the sandstorm\n\nFall to the ground all around\nThere's a wind blowing sand\nRaise your hand to your face\nBut you can't stop the sandstorm\nSandstorm\n\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\n\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\n\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\n\nFly with the clouds from the wind\nIn the desert there's a sandstorm\nDust in my eyes, in my ears\nThere's a rumour of a sandstorm\n\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\n\nSandstorm\nSandstorm\nnSandstorm

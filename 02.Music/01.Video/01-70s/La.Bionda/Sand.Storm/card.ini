[lyrics]
orig = Fly with the clouds from the wind\In the desert there's a sandstorm\Dust in my eyes, in my ears\There's a rumour of a sandstorm\Moments of a fear drawing near\Give me shelter from the sandstorm\Sandstorm\\See how the sun's burning eye\In the sky closes tight\Bringing night while we wait\In the gloom for the sandstorm\\Fall to the ground all around\There's a wind blowing sand\Raise your hand to your face\But you can't stop the sandstorm\\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\\Nowhere to run or to hide\From the fury of the sandstorm (sandstorm)\No one can say how much time\We must suffer in the sandstorm (sandstorm)\Each of us stands here alone\At the mercy of the sandstorm (sandstorm)\Sandstorm\\See how the sun's burning eye\In the sky closes tight\Bringing night while we wait\In the gloom for the sandstorm\\Fall to the ground all around\There's a wind blowing sand\Raise your hand to your face\But you can't stop the sandstorm\Sandstorm\\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\\Fly with the clouds from the wind\In the desert there's a sandstorm\Dust in my eyes, in my ears\There's a rumour of a sandstorm\\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\\Sandstorm\Sandstorm\nSandstorm

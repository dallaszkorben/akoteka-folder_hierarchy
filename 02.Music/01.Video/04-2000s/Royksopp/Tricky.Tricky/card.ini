lyrics_orig = Six afraid of seven 'cause seven, eight, nine\nI'm about to lose it the second time\nStaring at the wall hour after hour\nRunning up and down over and over\n\nIt's a tricky, tricky, this little one, two\nWell, if it is a lunatic we'll name it after you\nPut it in your pocket and pick it up\nWe're here to entertain, show them what you've got\n\nSix afraid of seven 'cause seven, eight, nine\nI'm afraid of losing the pieces I find\nIf I was created equal is this what I get?\nA bunch of stories to interpret\n\nReady to rock it like rock 'n' roll\nYou are the flower in glittering gold\nSleeping in the palm, the palm of my hand\nThey show you who to follow, it looks like a man\n\nSix afraid of seven 'cause seven, eight, nine\nI'm about to lose it the second time\nStaring at the wall hour after hour\nRunning up and down over and over\n\nReady to rock it like rock 'n' roll\nYou are the flower in glittering gold\nSleeping in the palm, the palm of my hand\nThey show you who to follow, it looks like a man

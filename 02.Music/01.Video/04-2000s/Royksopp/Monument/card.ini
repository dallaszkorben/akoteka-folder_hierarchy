orig = Make a space\nFor my body\nDig a hole\nPush the sides apart\nThis is what\nI'm controlling\nIt's a moat\nThe inside that I carve\nThis will be my monument\nThis will be a beacon when\nI'm gone\nGone, gone\nWhen I'm gone\nGone, gone\nWhen I'm gone\nSo that when the moment comes\nI can say I did it all with love\nLove, love\nAll with love\nLove, love\nAll with love\nMake a space\nFor my body\nDig a hole\nPush the sides apart\nThis is what\nI'm controlling\nIt's a moat\nThe inside that I carve\nThis will be my monument\nThis will be a beacon when\nI'm gone\nGone, gone\nWhen I'm gone\nGone, gone\nWhen I'm gone\nMake a cast\nOf my body\nPull back out\nSo that I can see\nLet go of\nHow you knew me\nLet go of\nWhat I used to be\nSo that when the moment comes\nI can say I did it all with love\nLove, love\nAll with love\nLove, love\nAll with love\nLove, love, love...\nAll with love\nLove, love, love...

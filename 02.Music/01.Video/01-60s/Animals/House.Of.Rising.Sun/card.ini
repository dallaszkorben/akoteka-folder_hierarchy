[lyrics]
orig = There is a house in New Orleans\nThey call the Rising Sun\nAnd it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\nAnd God, I know I'm one\n\nMy mother was a tailor\nShe sewed my new blue jeans\nMy father was a gambling man\nDown in New Orleans\n\nNow the only thing a gambler needs\nIs a suitcase and a trunk\nAnd the only time he is satisfied\nIs when he's on a drunk\n\nOh, mother, tell your children\nNot to do what I have done\nSpend your lives in sin and misery\nIn the House of the Rising Sun\n\nWell, I got one foot on the platform\nThe other foot on the train\nI'm goin' back to New Orleans\nTo wear that ball and chain\n\nWell, there is a house in New Orleans\nThey call the Rising Sun\nAnd it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\nAnd God, I know I'm one

en = Wonderful moment is to play,\nWhat if we try this game,\nWe never ride for burning, what if burning open space\n\nWe never held this broken light,\nForever true and alien,\nPlaning and rolling and roaming on roads and riding\nAway...\n\nOne riding for true love, and if you promise,\nSetting me in a garden, so I ain't need no more...\nForsaken wisdom every way,\nWhy turn and try to listen,\nSounds that we can't stop hearing,\nWhen our distance dissapearing,\nThey never gave you broken heart,\nYou're here to freely roam the land\n\nPlaning and rolling and roaming on roads and riding\nAway...\nRiding and riding and riding away...\n\nWonderful moment is to play,\nWhat if we try this game,\nWe never ride for burning, burning open space\n\nOne riding for true love, and if you promise...\nSetting me in the garden, so I ain't need no more...

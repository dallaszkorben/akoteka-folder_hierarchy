[lyrics]
orig = I give you my affection and I give you my time\nTrying to get a connection on the telephone line\nYou're so close but far away\nI call you up all night and day\n\nI give you my affection and I give you my time\nTrying to get a connection on the telephone line\nYou're so close but far away\nI call you up all night and day\nYou're so close but far away\nI call you up all night and day\n\nI give you my affection and I give you my time\nTrying to get a connection on the telephone line\nI call you up from time to time\nTo hear your voice on the telephone line\nI call you up from time to time\nTo hear your voice on the telephone line

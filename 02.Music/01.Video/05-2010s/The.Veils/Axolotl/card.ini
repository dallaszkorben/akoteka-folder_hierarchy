[lyrics]
orig = I'm glowing bright, obsidian\nAxolotl amphibian\nUn-elemental chemical\nGot me growing six black tentacles\nA little nightmarish, a little maudlin\nGood golly go get that kid some laudanum\nSalvation's more than I can afford\nWho needs the Devil when you've got the Lord?\n\nOh my soul\nLosing control\nWho built this heart?\nOh my God\n\nNow sister Maggie's coming in fleet-foot\nBaby's got a belly full of black soot\nI got the feeling I better just stay put\nAnd she'll love you better than any real man could\nAn accidental amphibian\nI'm growing giddy as a Gideon\nAnother head for the chopping board\nWho needs the Devil when you've got the Lord?\n\nOh my soul\nLosing control\nWho built this heart?\nOh my God

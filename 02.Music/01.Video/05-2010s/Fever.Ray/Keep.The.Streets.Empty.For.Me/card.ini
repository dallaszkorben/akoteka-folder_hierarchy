[lyrics]
orig = Memory comes when memory's old\nI am never the first to know\nFollowing the stream up North\nWhere do people like us float\nThere is room in my lap\nFor bruises, asses, handclaps\nI will never disappear\nFor forever, I'll be here\nWhispering\nMorning, keep the streets empty for me\nMorning, keep the streets empty for me\nI'm laying down, eating snow\nMy fur is hot, my tongue is cold\nOn a bed of spider web\nI think of how to change myself\nA lot of hope in a one man tent\nThere's no room for innocence\nSo take me home before the storm\nVelvet mites will keep us warm\nWhispering\nMorning, keep the streets empty for me\nMorning, keep the streets empty for me\nWhispering\nMorning, keep the streets empty for me\nMorning, keep the streets empty for me\nUncover our heads and reveal our souls\nWe were hungry before we were born\nUncover our heads and reveal our souls\nWe were hungry before we were born\nUncover our heads and reveal our souls\nWe were hungry before we were born\nUncover our heads and reveal our souls\nWe were hungry before we were born

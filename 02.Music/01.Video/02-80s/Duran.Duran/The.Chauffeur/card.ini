[lyrics]
orig = Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving\nAll looking for a new place to drive\nYou sit beside me so newly charming\nSweating dewdrops glisten freshing your side\n\nAnd the sun drips down bedding heavy behind\nThe front of your dress, all shadowy lined\nAnd the droning engine throbs in time\nWith your beating heart\n\nWay down the lane away, living for another day\nThe aphids swarm up in the drifting haze\nSwim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle\nMy envied lady holds you fast in her gaze\n\nAnd the sun drips down bedding heavy behind\nThe front of your dress, all shadowy lined\nAnd the droning engine throbs in time\nWith your beating heart\n\nAnd the sun drips down bedding heavy behind\nThe front of your dress, all shadowy lined\nAnd the droning engine throbs in time\nWith your beating heart\n\nSing blue silver\n\nAnd watching lovers part, I feel you smiling\nWhat glass splinters lie so deep in your mind\nTo tear out from your eyes, with a thought to stiffen brooding lies\nAnd I'll only watch you leave me further behind\n\nAnd the sun drips down bedding heavy behind\nThe front of your dress, all shadowy lined\nAnd the droning engine throbs in time\nWith your beating heart\n\nAnd the sun drips down bedding heavy behind\nThe front of your dress, all shadowy lined\nAnd the droning engine throbs in time\nWith your beating heart\n\nSing blue silver\nSing, sing, blue silver

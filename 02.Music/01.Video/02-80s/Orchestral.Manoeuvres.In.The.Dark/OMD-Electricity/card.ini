[lyrics]
orig = Our one source of energy\nThe ultimate discovery\nElectric blue for me\nNever more to be free\nElectricity\nNuclear and HEP\nCarbon fuels from the sea\nWasted electricity\n\nOur one source of energy\nElectricity\nAll we need to live today\nA gift for man to throw away\nThe chance to change has nearly gone\nThe alternative is only one\nThe final source of energy\nSolar electricity

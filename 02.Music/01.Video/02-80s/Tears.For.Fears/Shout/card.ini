orig = Shout, shout, let it all out\nThese are the things I can do without\nCome on\nI'm talking to you, come on\n\nShout, shout, let it all out\nThese are the things I can do without\nCome on\nI'm talking to you, come on\n\nIn violent times\nYou shouldn't have to sell your soul\nIn black and white\nThey really really ought to know\nThose one-track minds\nThat took you for a working boy\nKiss them goodbye\nYou shouldn't have to jump for joy\nYou shouldn't have to\n\nShout (jump for) shout (joy), let it all out\nThese are the things I can do without\nCome on\nI'm talking to you, come on\n\nThey gave you life\nAnd in return you gave them hell\nAs cold as ice\nI hope we live to tell the tale\nI hope we live to\n\nShout (tell the) shout (tale), let it all out\nThese are the things I can do without\nCome on\nI'm talking to you, come on\n\nShout, shout, let it all out\nThese are the things I can do without\nCome on\nI'm talking to you, come on\n\nShout, shout, let it all out (let it all out...)\nThese are the things I can do without\nCome on\nI'm talking to you, so come on\n\nAnd when you've taken down your guard\nIf I could change your mind\nI'd really love to break your heart\nI'd really love to break\n\nShout (break your), shout (heart), let it all out\nThese are the things I can do without (I'd really love to break your heart)\nCome on\nI'm talking to you, come on\n\nShout, shout, let it all out\nThese are the things I can do without\nCome on\nI'm talking to you, so come on

[lyrics]
orig = Ground Control to Major Tom\nGround Control to Major Tom\nTake your protein pills and put your helmet on\nGround Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six)\nCommencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three)\nCheck ignition and may God's love be with you (two, one, liftoff)\nThis is Ground Control to Major Tom\nYou've really made the grade\nAnd the papers want to know whose shirts you wear\nNow it's time to leave the capsule if you dare\n"This is Major Tom to Ground Control\nI'm stepping through the door\nAnd I'm floating in a most peculiar way\nAnd the stars look very different today\nFor here\nAm I sitting in a tin can\nFar above the world\nPlanet Earth is blue\nAnd there's nothing I can do\nThough I'm past one hundred thousand miles\nI'm feeling very still\nAnd I think my spaceship knows which way to go\nTell my wife I love her very much she knows\nGround Control to Major Tom\nYour circuit's dead, there's something wrong\nCan you hear me, Major Tom?\nCan you hear me, Major Tom?\nCan you hear me, Major Tom?\nCan you "Here am I floating 'round my tin can\nFar above the moon\nPlanet Earth is blue\nAnd there's nothing I can do"

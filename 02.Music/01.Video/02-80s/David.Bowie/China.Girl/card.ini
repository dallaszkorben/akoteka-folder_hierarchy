[lyrics]
orig = Oh, oh, oh, little China girl\nOh, oh, oh, little China girl\nI could escape this feeling, with my China girl\nI feel a wreck without my, little China girl\nI hear her heart beating, loud as thunder\nSaw they stars crashing\nI'm a mess without my, little China girl\nWake up mornings where's my, little China girl\nI hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder\nSaw they stars crashing down\nI feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando\nWhen I look at my China girl\nI could pretend that nothing really meant too much\nWhen I look at my China girl\nI stumble into town just like a sacred cow\nVisions of swastikas in my head\nPlans for everyone\nIt's in the whites of my eyes\nMy little China girl\nYou shouldn't mess with me\nI'll ruin everything you are\nYou know, I'll give you television\nI'll give you eyes of blue\nI'll give you men's who want to rule the world\nAnd when I get excited\nMy little China girl says\nOh baby, just you shut your mouth\nShe says, sh-sh-shhh\nShe says, sh-sh-shhh\nShe says\nShe says\nAnd when I get excited\nMy little China girl says\nOh baby, just you shut your mouth\nAnd when I get excited\nMy little China girl says\nOh baby, just you shut your mouth\nShe says, sh-sh-shhh\nShe says\nOh, oh, oh, little China girl\nOh, oh, oh, little China girl\nOh, oh, oh, little China girl\nOh, oh, oh, little China girl

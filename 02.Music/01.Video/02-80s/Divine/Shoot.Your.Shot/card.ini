orig = Don't ever stop doing what you're doing\nDon't stop, shoot your shot.\nDon't ever stop doing what you're doing\nDon't stop, shoot your shot.\n\nYou got what I want\nYou got what I need, shoot your shot.\nYou know how I feel\nCome on make it real, shoot your shot.\n\nNo matter what it takes\nIt's for you to make, shoot your shot.\nGive it all you got\nYou really got a lot, shoot your shot.\n\nYou got what I want\nYou got what I need, shoot your shot.\nYou know how I feel\nCome on make it real, shoot your shot.

[lyrics]
orig = Cover me with shades of disbelief\nCan happiness be someone's else's dream\nNumbers call to spell my name\nMove about as values change\nCatch me if you can but don't delay\nToday Today\nIt's a dream aw\nAy\nToday Today\nGoverned by the title on the wall\nCommit me to a life within a fool\nHappiness can often bleed\nBeggars lay among the sheep\nLet me take the choice the sermon pleads\nToday Today\nIt's a dream away\nToday Today\nA dream away\nVisions in my cell begin to breed\nWas everything a fact of what I'd read\nExcuse me while I spell my name\nBoat and ship could sound the same\nCatch me if you can but don't delay\nToday Today\nIt's a dream away\nToday Today\nA dream away\nBelle Malissima\nToday Toda\nWhy\nIt's a dream away\nToday Today\nA dream away

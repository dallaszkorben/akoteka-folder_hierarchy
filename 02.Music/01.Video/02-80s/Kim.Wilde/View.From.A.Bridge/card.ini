[lyrics]
orig = View from a bridge, can't take anymore\nView from a bridge, can't take anymore\n\nI guess it all began about a year ago\nLike a cheap love magazine\nYou know the kind you read about\nAnd have to laugh\nAt the pages in between\nNow I can't believe that fool inside is me\n'Cos I just can't face the world\nI've grown to see\n\nView from a bridge, can't take anymore\nView from a bridge, can't take anymore\n\nI saw you kissing her\nI saw you making her\nIn the soft sheets in between\nBut when you turned around\nI saw your eyes were fire\nAnd you crashed out all my dreams\n\nAnd like a fool I just stood there\nAnd let it go\nI should have fought right back\nAnd let my feelings show\n\nView from a bridge, can't take anymore\nView from a bridge, can't take anymore\n\nYou sure as hell knew how\nTo make a fool out of me\nWell you cut me down\nFor the things you want\nAnd now it's killing me\n\nI'll lay it on the line now\nYou're running out of time now\n\nBut then a voice said jump\nAnd I just let go\nAnd I'm floating out in space\nBut then I feel your arms\nAnd I turn around\nTo a ghost without a face\n\nAnd I just don't know\nWhat's fact or fantasy\n'Cos when I look below the bridgeI see it's me

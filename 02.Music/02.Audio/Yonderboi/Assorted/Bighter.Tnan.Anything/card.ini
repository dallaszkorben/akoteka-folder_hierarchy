orig = I try not to let this get bigger than it is\nI try not to let this get bigger than it is\nBigger than it is\nI try not to let this get\nBigger than it is\n\nIt's not about...\nI try not to let this get bigger than it is\n\nIt's not about what I sow\n\nI try not to let this get bigger than it is\nBigger than it is\n\nIt's not about what I say, it's about what I touch\nSo how come you don't listen to me?\nHow come I say this much?\nIt's not about what I say, it's about what I touch\nSo how come you don't listen to me?\nHow come I say this much?\nIt's not about what I say, it's about what I touch\nSo how come you don't listen to me?\nHow come I say this much?\nIt's not about what I show, it's about what I'm in\nSo how can you just glow\nBrighter than anything?

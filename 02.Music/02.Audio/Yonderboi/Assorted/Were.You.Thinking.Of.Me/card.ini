[lyrics]
orig = It was the day when they put her on the cover\nThey found the corpse in the back of a Mercury\nThey got her laptop picking all the numbers\nTrying to reach that they never meant to reach\nThey called a top doc messing with the data\nTrying to help but they couldn't eventually\nShe's a rough cut\nShe's a top tough stuff\n\nOh, were you thinking of me?\nOh, were you thinking of me?\nOh, were you thinking of me?\nWith a love like that\n\nIt was a night,well a night just like the others\nPicked up the pack that she always gave to me\nShe wore her lacquer top\nTripping undercover\nGot in her car, just to never get back to me\nSneak in her room, she's missing all her lovers\nI really hope I can get away with it\nShe's a top cop\nShe's a top ten stuff

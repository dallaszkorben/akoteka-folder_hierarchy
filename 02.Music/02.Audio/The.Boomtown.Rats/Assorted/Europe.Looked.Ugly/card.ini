orig = Europe looked ugly the very last time that I saw her\nTall and so empty, she sucks on her teeth and looks tired\nShe picks up her skirt, still coiled ad no longer worth knowing\nShe grins toothlessly and see the light die in her eyes\n\nI'm taking my time, I'm taking my time- I won't hurry\nI sit and I watch the last train to leave for a while\nAnd the buildings themselves seem to sag from the effortless standing\nWell the trees and the people are bent from the effort of dying\n\nSo I watched up from the window, and she opened her legs wide before me\nAnd the trails through the bile leave tracks like a steel slug on slime\nWell, me I keep thinking 'bout the iron that surrounds her, protects her\n'Cus a chastity belt for a whore seems almost too sublime\n\nOh, oh, oh\nWhat do we do now?\nWo, oh-oh-oh-ohh\nWhat do we do now?\nWith you and your stories\nWe feel sorry for you\nWith you and your stories\nWe feel sorry for you\nYeah we do\n\nI don't like my body, the things that it needs just disgust me\nI don't like my mind, the things that I think aren't quite sane\nBut I can still function normal, so long as my mouth moves\nI think it's the culture, I'm lucky they can't see my brain\n\nHey, hey, oh\nWhat do we do now?\nWo-oh-oh-oh-ohh\nWhat do we do now?\nWith you and your stories\nWe feel sorry for you\nWith you and your stories\nWe feel sorry for you, and you, and you\nOh, What do we do now?\nWo-oh-oh-oh-oh, What do we do now?\nWith me in your stories\nI feel sorry for you\nIn three of my stories\nI felt you\nYeah we do\n\nEurope looked ugly the very last time that I saw her

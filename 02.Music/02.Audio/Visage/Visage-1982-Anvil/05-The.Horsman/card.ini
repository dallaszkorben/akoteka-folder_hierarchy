orig = See him move across the burning sand in the day sun\nWatch the sweeping shadows span 'til the night comes\nMan and beast in that ancient stance, it's the horseman\n(Horseman!)\n\nSilhouetting the desert sky in a strange haze\nRiding strong with the note, I'm high in a strange daze\nSlowly he smiles, silently sighs\nSlither to black, shading his eyes\nNothing changes, nothing stops the horseman\n(Horseman!)\n\nThe race is on again\nThe pace is on again\nThe moves are from the reign\nThe straps are pulling hard\nThe sweat is running hot\nThe light is dimming fast\nHis task is almost done\nHis race is almost won\nHis journey nears it's end\nFool, passionate delight\nCuts through his heart tonight\nHe screams all night!\n\nOh, the horseman!\n(Oh the horseman...)

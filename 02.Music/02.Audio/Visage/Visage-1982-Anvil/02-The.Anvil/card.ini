orig = Lost amongst the crowd\nOn the torso's pumping iron\nA man with a horn takes to the stage\nThe drum beat cracks in time\n\nHarder and bolder, the bodies move\nShoulder to shoulder, skin feels smooth\nPalms sticky, still so cool\nThe crash of the anvil at the nightclub school\n\nWatch the moving bodies\nAs they react to the sound\nFeasting on the visions\nSee the figures going round\n\nGraceful and flowing, the fashion shows\nSensual and glowing, the passion grows\nPick your playmate, still so cool\nThe crash of the anvil at the nightclub school\n\nTake it as it comes up\nLeave it when it's done\nPut a number in your matchbook\nAnd call when you want fun\n\nLiving the nightlife to the end\nGiving the right life like a friend\nOne more rover, still so cool\nThe crash of the anvil at the nightclub school\n\nAh nightclub school\n\nDance with me\nAh nightclub school\n\nPlay with me\nAh nightclub school\n\nStay with me\nAh nightclub school\n\nRide with me\nAh nightclub school\n\nHave fun with me\nAh nightclub school\n\nDance with me\nAh nightclub school\n\nThe drumbeat cracks in time\n\nAh nightclub school\n\nAh nightclub school

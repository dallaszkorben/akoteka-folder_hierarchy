orig = Name the place, for a rendez-vous\nName the time and I'll get to you\nTake a train, take a motorway\nAnd take a plane, take it any day\nAnd take a drink, as you leave the ground\nTime to think, hearing headphone sound\nClose your eyes, you're drifting far away\nRealise, that you'll be home today\n\nVisa-age\n(I know the place)\nVisa-age\n(I can't forget)\nVisa-age\n(I'll go direct)\nVisa-age\n\nLeave the trash, of your life behind\nIt's time to move, shake those ties that bind\nLetting go, all that's old and blue\nYou've gotta know, just where you're going to\nSo take a chance and take a case in hand\nWe find romance, it's a far off land\nClose your eyes, you're drifting far away\nAnd realise, you could be there today\n\nVisa-age\n(A different town)\nVisa-age\n(Another place)\nVisa-age\n(Destinations)\nVisa-age\n\nI know you from somewhere\nI know we've met\n\nVisa-age\n(A different town)\nVisa-age\n(Another place)\nVisa-age\n(These destinations)\nVisa-age\n\nSo faint in the distance\nA speck on the map\nA stamp on my passport\nNo time to look back...

orig = My painted face\nIs chipped and cracked\nMy mind seems\nTo fade too fast\nClutching straws\nSinking slow\nNothing less, nothing less\n\nA puppet's motions\nControlled by a string\nBy a stranger\nI've never met\nA nod of the head\nAnd a pull of the thread\nI can't say no, can't say no\n\nWhen a child throws out a toy\nWhen I was new you wanted me\nNow I'm old you no longer see\n\nWhen a child throws out a toy\nSpiteful girl\nHateful boy\nWhen a child throws out a toy\n\nI'm all dressed up\nAnd nowhere to go\nOn a music box\nThat never stops\nI'll dance for you\nIf you want me to\nMove in time, move in time\n\nA wooden head\nAnd a broken heart\nUsed, abused\nAnd torn apart\nI gave you my best\nAnd you gave me the rest\nIt's time to die, time to die\n\nWhen a child throws out a toy\nWhen I was new you wanted me\nNow I'm old you no longer see\n\nWhen a child throws out a toy\nSpiteful girl\nHateful boy\nWhen a child throws out a toy\n\nWhen a child throws out a toy\nWhen I was new you wanted me\nNow I'm old you no longer see\n\nWhen a child throws out a toy\nSpiteful girl\nHateful boy\nWhen a child throws out a toy

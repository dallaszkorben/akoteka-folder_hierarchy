You've gone too far this time\nYou're toying with reality\n\nBlocks on blocks are all around\nNeon lit for silent sound\n\nFigures (in a doorway) in the night\nDancing (moving shadows) with the light\nTalking to a stranger\nOn the bridges built so close to that aura\n\nStanding, on a runway all alone\nListening, to an engine heading home\nCrying, on the inside\nWishing I could get away from that aura\n\nLying, on the runway all alone\nListening to an engine heading home\nStop! you've gone too far this time\nYou're toying with reality

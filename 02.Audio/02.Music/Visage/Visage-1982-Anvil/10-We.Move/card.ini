[storyline]
storyline_en = We move, in mysterious ways\nWe move, slip and slide cut through the haze\nAnd even as I stand in the room\nListening to all of the silence around\nI feel disco and not so some tune\nBeating inside make my feet touch the ground\nThen we move\n\nWe move, as the music sways\nWe move, like the good book says\nI feel my face reflected around\nHot on my heels closing in more and more\nThe piper plays a beckoning sound\nLeading them on 'til their feet reach the floor\nThen we move\n\nWe dance\nWe dance\nWe dance\nWe dance\nThen we move

orig = The message\nIn a faded envelope\nIn a vice-like grip\n\nThe passage\nOf a carriage in the dark\nOn a foreign trip (again)\n\nThe image\nOf a figure in the trees\nIn the evening rain\n\nThe knowledge\nOf a stranger in your midst\nOn a speeding train (again)\n\nNight train\n\nHe senses\nPerfume lingers in the night\nSmell of French cologne\n\nHe watches\nAs a hand turns down the light\nLeaves him all alone (again)\n\nHe whispers\nIn a dim lit empty room\nBut it's all in vain\n\nHe laughs\nWhen he reads the note he finds\nOn the midnight train (again)\n\nNight train\nJourney on the night train

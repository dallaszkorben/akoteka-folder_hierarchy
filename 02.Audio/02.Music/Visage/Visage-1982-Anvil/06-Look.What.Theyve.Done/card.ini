orig = Through the walls, I can hear them talk about\nSomeone who sounds alot like me\nWhispers so soft (it really doesn't matter)\nWhispers so clear (it really doesn't matter)\nWhat have they done to me?\n\nWhat have they done to me?\nWhat have they done to me?\nWhat have they done to me?\nWhat have they done to me?\n\nBehind their hands, I can see them smile at me\nTear apart everything I do\nPulling me down (it really doesn't matter)\nUnder the ground (it really doesn't matter)\nWhat have they done to me?\n\nWhat have they done to me?\nWhat have they done to me?\nWhat have they done to me?\nWhat have they done to me?\n\n(The pain... it's so strange...)\n(It's not the same... it's so strange...)\n\nWhat have they done to me?

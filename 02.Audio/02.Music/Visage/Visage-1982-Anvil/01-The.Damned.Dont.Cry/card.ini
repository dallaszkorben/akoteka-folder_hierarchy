[storyline]
orig = 
en = Travelling with no destination\nNo place to go\nNameless towns with faceless people\nNo place I know\n\nTime to close my mind and drift off\nTo other scenes\nLose myself in glossy pages\nDull magazines\n\nMoments pass by, oh so slowly\nMakes me lonely too\nTwisting street light, in the darkness\nMakes me lonely too\n\nAh the damned don't cry\nNo the damned don't cry\n\nClimbing smoke climbs upward slowly\nPast my trembling face\nI see myself in rain soaked windows\nIn a different place\n\nSingle heartbeats in the dim light\nMakes me lonely too\nHearing sounds of celebrations\nMakes me lonely too

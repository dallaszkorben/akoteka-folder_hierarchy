[storyline]
storyline_en = My shining hour has come upon me here\nThe moment lingers in my room\nThese words of mad music ringing clear\nI drink them in but it's gone too soon\n\nWe cry\nWe sigh\nAgain we love\n\nAnd in my sweating palm, I hold the key\nThe image deja-vu's again\nMy head is spinning with rhapsody\nThe moment's over but it's not the end\n\nWe cry\nWe sigh\nAgain we love\nAgain we love\nAgain we love\nAgain we love\n\nThese passing shapes feel so cool to me\nThe taste of perfume in the air\nThe crystal shimmer of a blue sea\nSun kissed beaches, but there's no one there\n\nWe cry\nWe sigh\nAgain we love\nAgain we love\nAgain we love...

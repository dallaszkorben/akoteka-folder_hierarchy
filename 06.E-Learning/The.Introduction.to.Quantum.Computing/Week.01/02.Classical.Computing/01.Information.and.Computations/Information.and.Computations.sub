00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.835
It's time for us to go on,

2
00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:19.775
and we are going to examine
the name of the course, the words.

3
00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:23.595
Here, The Introduction
to Quantum Computing.

4
00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:25.455
I believe there is no problem with

5
00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:27.480
understanding the words introduction,

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.015
and the, and to.

7
00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:35.970
But the words quantum
computing may be unclear.

8
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.775
So, let's explain them and we start
with computation or computer.

9
00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:46.270
How would you define
this term, this word?

10
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.045
If you reflect a bit on this notion,

11
00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:54.230
you may find it difficult to define.

12
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.415
What does it mean to compute?

13
00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.980
It is among those words
which we take for granted,

14
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.780
but if a child asks us to define it,

15
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.710
we have problems with that.

16
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.690
Actually with children
it is easier we

17
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.720
can instead of an explanation
or a definition,

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.225
we can provide some examples.

19
00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:21.889
But here, it doesn't work
because to generalize

20
00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.330
all these examples into

21
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.095
some short and simple
definition like this one.

22
00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:32.445
The computation is
a physical process,

23
00:01:32.445 --> 00:01:38.405
finite in time with fixed and
distinguishable set of states.

24
00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:42.000
A set of distinguishable states.

25
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.565
Now you understand that there are

26
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:51.650
many other definitions of this term
or this word, computation.

27
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.270
Why I do like this the most,

28
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.350
and why I choose this
for this course?

29
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.070
Because first it amplifies
the notion of a physical process.

30
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.860
We often forget this
that the things that

31
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.375
compute often and usually rattle,

32
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:16.170
clique, and make
different noise like this.

33
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.375
They usually, not usually,

34
00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:29.030
always they consume or transform,

35
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.890
if you want, energy.

36
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.660
Now, this notion of states,

37
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.350
there are many process in
the world which rattle

38
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.380
and consume energy but if

39
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.125
they don't have this distinguishable
states which again identify,

40
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:50.000
then we don't call them a computer.

41
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.995
It is often told that

42
00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:55.400
computations transform
or process information.

43
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.840
To agree with that,

44
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.510
we have to think again and to
define this word, information.

45
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.850
I choose to connect this definition

46
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.385
with that of computational system of

47
00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:18.830
computations since
computational process

48
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.735
has a fixed state set of
distinguishable states.

49
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:26.150
I choose the current state of

50
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.215
the system to be
the information it presents.

51
00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:33.880
I choose the word interpretation
here for a reason.

52
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.980
Because you see on this slide
two different systems,

53
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.965
both can store some information.

54
00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:42.265
In some cases, we can say that

55
00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:46.600
these two systems store
the same information.

56
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.690
But how can we do that?

57
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.205
These are very different systems,

58
00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:55.615
they have very different
sets of states.

59
00:03:55.615 --> 00:04:00.290
How can we say that they
store the same information?

60
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.915
To do that, we have to define,

61
00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:06.175
to invent some conventions

62
00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:10.495
about how we would interpret
this system states,

63
00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:13.600
how would we read
information from them.

64
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.460
To do that, we first have

65
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.705
to define the notion of
quantity of information.

66
00:04:20.705 --> 00:04:26.045
Because, for example, we might
need to establish the fact

67
00:04:26.045 --> 00:04:28.130
that one system can store

68
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.810
the information stored
now by another system.

69
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.220
We may already feel that
this notion of quantity is somehow

70
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.740
connected with the number of
states available for this system.

71
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.845
The first mathematical
description of this notion

72
00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:49.430
of quantity of information
was introduced

73
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.645
in 1948 by an American Mathematician

74
00:04:56.645 --> 00:04:59.270
and Crypto Analyst, Claude Shannon.

75
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.980
The amount of information
that can be stored by

76
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.840
a system with N states was
defined by his famous formula,

77
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.170
the Shannon's formula here.

78
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:18.450
Here, you can see the sum over
all states of the probabilities of

79
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.230
each state multiplied by

80
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.740
the logarithm sum base B
of this probability.

81
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.975
We want this value to be positive,

82
00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:34.070
so this is why there's
minus here because

83
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.625
all the logarithms here are negative.

84
00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:41.110
Now, the probabilities
come from Physics.

85
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.230
This formula was
introduced by Boltzmann

86
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.675
to define the entropy of a system.

87
00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:51.235
The physicists are interested in

88
00:05:51.235 --> 00:05:54.535
much more general set
of physical processes.

89
00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:59.535
But for computational processes
at least designed by human,

90
00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:02.920
all this probabilities usually
are equal to each other.

91
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.985
So, for any I and J
probability of the state

92
00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:12.880
I equals to the probability
of state J and everything

93
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.830
is equal to one divided
by the number of states,

94
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.555
by N. In this case,

95
00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:24.215
for the case of equiprobable states,

96
00:06:24.215 --> 00:06:29.290
we have simplification
of this formula.

97
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.625
Instead of PI, we just
write one divided by N,

98
00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:39.870
and logarithm base B
of Y one divided by N,

99
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:47.180
and we can invert this logarithm
like this and remove this minus.

100
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.589
Now, we have this sum
of equal elements,

101
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.030
there are N elements.

102
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.210
So, we can write it like this

103
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:08.015
and we can now erase this
and we have this logarithm.

104
00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:12.890
So, the amount of information
stored by a system with

105
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.470
N equiprobable states is

106
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.790
just the logarithm base B
of the number of states.

107
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.120
Now, let's take a closer look
at this value B here.

108
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.654
Actually it is a matter
of convention,

109
00:07:28.654 --> 00:07:34.750
and the smallest natural base
for the logarithm is two.

110
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.050
If I take a system
with only one state,

111
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.290
you see it is zero.

112
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.845
So, a system with only one
state stores no information.

113
00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:53.630
The next number is two.

114
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.705
So, logarithm two, two equals to one.

115
00:07:58.705 --> 00:08:01.920
This is the amount of information,

116
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.700
the smallest amount
of information that

117
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.120
can be stored by a physical system.

118
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.600
Claude Shannon called
this smallest amount

119
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.740
of information whose logarithm
is the smallest base,

120
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.560
he named it bit,

121
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.130
as a small piece of
something in English.

122
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.460
Now, we can measure
information in bits.

123
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.695
Imagine a system which stores n bits.

124
00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:41.215
That means that this system has
two in the power of N states.

125
00:08:41.215 --> 00:08:45.005
It is the same amount
as the amount of

126
00:08:45.005 --> 00:08:50.360
integer numbers which can be
represented by N binary digits.

127
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.130
So, we can now enumerate the states.

128
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:59.035
We can assign each state its number.

129
00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:01.675
If you have two systems,

130
00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:05.480
each of them which can store n bits,

131
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.860
and the states of these systems
are enumerated like this,

132
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:18.780
then we can map the states
of different systems.

133
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.275
We can now say that

134
00:09:21.275 --> 00:09:25.070
these different systems
store the same information.

135
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.650
Let's consider an example.

136
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.630
The system depicted here was
never implemented physically,

137
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.205
it was designed as a thought
experiment by a Hungarian physicist,

138
00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:48.540
Leo Szilard, in 1929.

139
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.330
So, the system is like this.

140
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.620
It is an empty camera.

141
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.780
It is partitioned,
removable partition here.

142
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.430
Which divides the camera
in two parts.

143
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:11.695
There is one particle
of gas in the camera

144
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:17.050
of the temperature T. By
the size of the camera,

145
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:23.755
there are pistons which can
be moved inside the camera,

146
00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:29.330
but they can't be moved outside
because of these stoppers here.

147
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.270
We will distinguish
two states for this system.

148
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:45.205
The particle stays somewhere here
in the left part of the camera.

149
00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:48.340
We'll call this state zero.

150
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.330
If the particle stays in
the right part of the camera,

151
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.660
we'll call this, one.

152
00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:01.580
So, this system can store
one bit of information.

153
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.935
Okay. When the partition is removed,

154
00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:10.480
it is not actually a computational
system, computational process,

155
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.010
because we can't distinguish
these two different states.

156
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:19.750
We can say in which part
of the camera,

157
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.615
now we can find the particle.

158
00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.250
But we can do this,

159
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:29.030
we can assign this system
a particular value.

160
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.800
To do that, we have to

161
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.330
remove this partition if
it's not yet removed,

162
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:43.225
and then we are going
to compress the gas.

163
00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:48.550
For example, we want the system
to represent the value zero.

164
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:55.615
So, we fix this piston,

165
00:11:55.615 --> 00:12:02.330
and we move the right
piston on the left.

166
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.110
So, we compress our one particle gas,

167
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.920
and we stop when

168
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.200
this right piston reaches
the middle of the camera,

169
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.370
and replace the moveable partition.

170
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.340
Then, we can move
our right piston back.

171
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.865
Now, we are sure that the particle

172
00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:34.195
stays here in the left
part of the camera,

173
00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:38.450
and this process took
some effort from us,

174
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:45.985
which equals to a constant,
the Boltzmann's constant,

175
00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:49.825
the temperature of
the gas and the logarithm

176
00:12:49.825 --> 00:12:55.040
of the fraction of volumes.

177
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.910
We decreased the volume two times,

178
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.250
so this equals to two.

179
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:10.720
This is how much work we

180
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:18.160
need to assign a value,

181
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.700
and this is a very interesting fact.

182
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.570
To assign a value,

183
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:30.530
we have to dissipate some energy.

184
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.200
Let's do something else.

185
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.435
For example, we now have this value
or this bit equal to zero,

186
00:13:40.435 --> 00:13:46.360
let's apply the NOT gate
which maps zero to one.

187
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.920
How can we do this?

188
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.230
We now have this state.

189
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:09.860
Now, we can move this right piston
here to the partition,

190
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.790
and this doesn't take

191
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.775
any effort because we
don't compress the gas,

192
00:14:15.775 --> 00:14:18.520
there's no gas on the right side.

193
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.299
Then, we remove the partition,

194
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:33.380
and then we move both pistons
to the right like this.

195
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.080
The volume of the gas does not change

196
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:56.150
when we place this volume on
the right part of the camera.

197
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.865
We place the partition
again and then we

198
00:15:05.865 --> 00:15:10.630
remove or move back the left piston.

199
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.350
Well, we applied to the gate NOT,

200
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.805
we're now pretty sure that

201
00:15:15.805 --> 00:15:18.610
the particle stays in
the right part of the camera,

202
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:24.450
so this system stores the bit one.

203
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:28.900
We did not dissipate any energy.

204
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.000
It didn't do any work.

205
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.025
So, our gate NOT,

206
00:15:33.025 --> 00:15:39.025
the reversible gate
doesn't take any energy,

207
00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:43.730
and this system doesn't
need any energy.

208
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.190
Now, assume that we don't

209
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.360
need to store these bits
anymore, what can we do?

210
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.915
We, just like in this case here,

211
00:15:55.915 --> 00:15:58.315
we can just remove

212
00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:05.185
the partition and let this particle
fly all around the camera.

213
00:16:05.185 --> 00:16:10.435
But we can do something more
clever or something more smart.

214
00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:19.160
We can put this piston back
here with again no work,

215
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.190
and then remove the partition and let

216
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:34.420
this particle to push
this piston back.

217
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:42.565
So, this compressed gas will give
us this amount of energy back,

218
00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:45.770
and this operation is called erase.

219
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.225
Now, what does it mean?
It means that if we know

220
00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:57.820
in which part of this camera
we now have a particle,

221
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.215
we can transform
this knowledge into energy.

222
00:17:02.215 --> 00:17:08.095
So, the information in
some sense equals to energy.

223
00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:10.825
Imagine that we didn't
have this partition,

224
00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:13.135
and at each point of time,

225
00:17:13.135 --> 00:17:22.690
we can find out where
this particle is.

226
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:31.900
So, we can place the partition and
move the piston of our choice.

227
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.345
So, we can extract some work,

228
00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:37.610
some energy of this system.

229
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.915
So, the information in
some sense equals to energy,

230
00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:50.155
and this is why it's often said
that information is power.

231
00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:55.520
Bad news for Plato
and Socrates, though.

orig = This module focuses on how to have your Raspberry Pi interact with online services through the use of public APIs and SDKs. Many interesting and useful services are available in the cloud and this module describes how to write code that accesses those services. We define what an Application Programming Interface (API) is and what a Software Development Kit (SDK) is. We present some API examples and we show the use of the Twitter API in detail using the Twython package.\n\nKey Concepts\n1. Protocol-specific libraries\n2. Online services: Application programming interface (API); Software development kit (SDK)\n3. Sentiment analysis example\n4. Twitter’s API; Registering your twitter app; Authentication keys\n5.

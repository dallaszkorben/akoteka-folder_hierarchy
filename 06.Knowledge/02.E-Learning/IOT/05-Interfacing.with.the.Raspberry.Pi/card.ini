[storyline]
orig = Welcome to Interfacing with the Raspberry Pi! You’re joining hundreds of students currently enrolled in the course. I'm excited to have you and I look forward to helping you learn more about the Raspberry Pi.\n\nTo begin, I recommend taking a few minutes to explore the course site. A good place to start is the navigation bar on the left. Click Course Content to see what material we’ll cover each week, as well as preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course.\n\nHardware Requirements:\n\nFor both this course and the next one in this series, we expect that you have a Raspberry Pi B+ board, an HDMI cable, a USB keyboard and mouse, and a USB WiFi adapter. We recommend the CanaKit Raspberry Pi 2 Complete Starter Kit with WiFi Adapter.\n\nWe also assume that you have the following components:\n\n    1 breadboard\n    6 wires with female leads, 24 AWG (or 2 servo cables)\n    8 wires which can fit a breadboard (24 AWG)\n    3 LEDs\n    2 pushbuttons which can be mounted into a breadboard\n    3 1 KOhm resistors\n    2 10 KOhm resistors\n\nWe also assume that you have components from the Arduino Uno Rev 3 Ultimate Starter Kit from www.vilros.com, but these are not essential.\n\nThis course should take about 4 weeks to complete. You can check out the recommended course schedule below to see a quick overview of the lessons and assignments you’ll complete each week.

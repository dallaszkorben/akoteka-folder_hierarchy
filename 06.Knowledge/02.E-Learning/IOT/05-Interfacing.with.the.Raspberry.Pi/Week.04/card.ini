[storyline]
orig = In this module we show how to use the Raspberry Pi to interface with more complicated sensors and actuators. We explore the use of the Raspberry Pi camera module and the use of a servo. The Raspberry Pi camera module is used through the picamera library, which we describe. Servos are controlled by generating pulse width modulated signals and varying their pulse width using library functions.\n\nKey Concepts\n1. Raspberry Pi Camera Module\n2. Picamera library\n3. Camera functions: capture images, change settings, capture video, timelapse photos\n4. Pulse Width Modulation\n5. Servo control

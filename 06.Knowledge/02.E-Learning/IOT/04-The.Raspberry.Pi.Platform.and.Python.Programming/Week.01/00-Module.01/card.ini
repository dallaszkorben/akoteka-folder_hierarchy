[storyline]
orig = This module describes the basic functionality the Raspberry Pi B+ board. I'll describe how to set up the board, configure it, and use it. An important point differentiating Raspberry Pi from the Arduino platform which we have talked about previously is that Raspberry Pi uses an operating system. I'll describe some of the implications of an operating system on the behavior of the Raspberry Pi as an IoT device.\n\n\nKey Concepts\n\n    1. Understand the components on the board and their functions\n    2. Install the Raspbian Linux distribution\n    3. Configure Raspbian for the Raspberry Pi\n    4. Set up boot options for Raspbian\n    5. Overclock the Raspberry Pi

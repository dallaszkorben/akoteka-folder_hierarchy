[storyline]
orig = In this module we describe how to communicate with devices through the pins of the Raspberry Pi. We examine the RPi.GPIO library which provides Python functions used to access the pins. We discuss how to set up the pins, apply digital voltages, and generate Pulse Width Modulated signals. We also describe the Tkinter Python library and show how it can be used to access pins through a graphic user interface.\n\n\nKey Concepts\n\n    • Describe the features of the general purpose input/output pins\n    • Use the GPIO library to access the GPIO pins\n    • Control hardware through a graphic user interface

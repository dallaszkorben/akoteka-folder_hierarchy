[storyline]
orig = A power supply is an essential piece of equipment for any electronics experimenter. While you can get by with USB adapters and “wall warts” having a capable high-current source of 3.3, 5 and 12 volt DC power will take your experimenting to another level.\n\n\nCommercial power supplies with these sorts of current capabilities can be very expensive, however, there is a much cheaper alternative. With some simple wiring, you can convert an ATX power supply form a desktop computer into a reliable and capable workbench power supply.\n\nEven if you need to purchase a new ATX power supply this method is still a lot cheaper than buying a commercial workbench power supply. And chances are that you won't need to spend any money at all on the ATX power supply, I salvaged mine from an old Windows XP computer and it works just great.\n\nThere are two types of ATX power supplies commonly in use, I will show you the differences between them. Either model can be used in this project.\n\nHere is the Table of Contents for the video:\n\n  Parts used in Project - 4:36\n  ATX Supply pinouts - 10:06\n  ATX Supply Inside - 13:46\n  Testing ATX Supply - 16:17\n  Hookup Diagram - 19:14\n  Building the Power Supply - 22:48\n  Testing the Power Supply - 30:17\n  Adding a Power Meter - 31:59\n\nOne note - there are many ways to do this and I outline a few of them in the video. Several methods (including the one I used) involve opening up the ATX power supply. If you do that BE VERY CAREFUL as some of the components in the supply can retain a high-voltage charge for hours or even days after the supply has been unplugged.\n\nIf you are unsure about opening up a power supply (or if you have a new one still under warranty) don’t do it, you can still build this project another way. I go over that at the conclusion of the video.\n\nAs always there is an article on the DroneBot Workshop website that accompanies this video, you can read it at https://dbot.ws/atxpwr. \n\nBTW, I needed this power supply as I’m going to use it during the development of a really big project that I’m just getting started on.

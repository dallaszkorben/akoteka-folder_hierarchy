[storyline]
orig = Today we will build a useful bench power supply that thas both a fixed (5-volt) output and a variable 0 -17-volt output. Its a useful addition to any workbench, and it’s safe and easy to build.\n\n\nWe’ll repurpose a common netbook power adapter, there are thousands of these lying around from computers that have seen better days. They commonly have a 19-volt output, with decent current capabilities.\n\nThe design is further simplified by using some buck converter modules, one for a fixed output and one with a variable output and a digital display.  The convertor I used even has a memory feature, allowing you to store and recall multiple output voltages. It was easily available on Amazon.\n\nThis is really easy to build, so even if you are just getting started its a great project. And as all the nasty high-voltages are safely tucked away in the power brick you don’t need to worry about shocking yourself.\n\nHere is what we will be covering today:\n\n  Power Supply Design & Components - 5:56\n  Wiring Diagram - 6:42\n  Getting all the parts together - 7:54\n  Testing the Modules - 11:44\n  Building the Power Supply - 16:15\n  Testing the Power Supply - 21:16\n\n\nI didn’t have time to paint or label the case but even so, this build looks pretty good, thanks to the “DROK 180081 Numerical Control Step Down Voltage Regulator” that forms the heart of the design. I picked mine up on Amazon, along with the “LM2596 DC to DC Buck Converter” modules used for the fixed output.\n\nYou don’t have to build the exact power supply I did, you can use this technique for repurposing old power adapters to create all sorts of custom power supplies. Just make sure to observe the current rating and the polarity of the supply output.

[storyline]
orig = In an earlier video, I showed you how to control DC devices with an Arduino using BJTs and MOSFETs. Today we will learn how to control Alternating Current or AC devices. And, most importantly, I’ll show you how to experiment with AC in a safe and controlled fashion.\n\n\nControlling AC using semiconductors is a challenge, as most transistors only conduct current in one direction. One type of semiconductor that will do the job is the TRIAC, which itself is essentially a fusion of two Silicon Controlled Rectifiers, or SCRs.\n\nAnother way of controlling AC (or DC for that matter) is a good old-fashioned relay. Although relays have been around for over 180 years they are still a popular and practical solution for controlling AC devices.\n\nOne extremely important issue when controlling line-voltage (or mains voltage, if you prefer) AC current is isolation. You need to make absolutely sure that there is no electrical connection between your low-voltage logic circuitry and the high-voltage AC.\n\nAn excellent device for achieving this isolation is an optoisolator. This device separates the two circuits with a beam of infrared light, completely isolating them.\n\nPut an optoisolator together with a TRIAC and you have a Solid State Switch, or Solid State Relay (SSR).  Combine an optoisolator with a relay and driver transistor and you have a Relay Module.  We’ll be using both of these devices with an Arduino today.\n\nHere is the Table of Contents for today's video:\n\n  Controlling AC - 3:06\n  Alternating Current Safety - 8:00\n  My AC Workbench Setup - 9:28\n  Using Relays - 12:39\n  Arduino Light-Controlled Relay - 16:34\n  Using Solid State Switches - 24:29\n  Arduino Light Chaser - 28:43\n  IoT Relay - 36:24\n\nThe last item, the “IoT Relay”, is a commercial product that allows you to safely switch any AC device without having to build anything. It’s certified for use in the US and Canada and is perfect for those who just want to get the job done, or who are uncomfortable working with high-voltage AC.  \n\nIt also lets you use the Blink sketch to flash a desk-lamp!/

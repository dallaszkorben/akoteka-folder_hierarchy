[storyline]
orig = Today we will look at another proximity sensor, the RCWL-0516. This device works using microwaves and the Doppler Effect to detect the presence of humans (and other creatures) in a room.  It is inexpensive and can be used by itself or in conjunction with an Arduino.\n\n\nDon’t be concerned about the microwave aspect, this device emits a very low level of microwave radiation at 3.18 GHz, which is on the low-end of the microwave spectrum. It is perfectly safe to experiment with and to use in your projects.\n\nThe device is very inexpensive and can be obtained on eBay, Amazon and probably at your local electronics shop (which is where I got mine) for around 2-3 US dollars.\n\nThe RCWL-0516 operates using the “Doppler Effect”, a phenomenon discovered in 1842 by Austrian physicist Christian Doppler.  The Doppler Effect describes a change in frequency observed by a stationary observer when the source of the frequency is moving.\n\nIf you have ever heard the sound of a train as it races towards and then away from you, or an ambulance as it races down the road, you will have heard the siren frequency changing as the object approaches, passes and moves away from you. That is the Doppler Effect in action. \n\nIn the RCWL-0515 microwaves are sent out and reflected back. Any moving object in the area will change the frequency of the reflected waves, thus triggering the device.\n\nI will show you how to use the RCWL-0516 on its own, both by itself and with an optional light sensor. You'll see that because it uses microwaves it is still operational even when encased in a  plastic enclosure.\n\nThen we will use an Arduino with the RCWL-0516. I’ll show you how to make the device “latch”, great for an intruder alarm or automatic light switch. Then I will show you how I built a remote sensor using a RCWL-0516 and two Arduino's.\n\nHere is the Table of Contents for today's video:\n\n  The RCWL-0516 & Doppler Effect - 3:12\n  Basic Hookup & Demo - 9:33\n  Light Sensor Hookup & Demo - 12:35\n  Arduino Latching Device Hookup & Code - 15:14\n  Arduino Latching Device Demo - 20:31\n  Arduino Remote - Transmitter Hookup & Code - 23:44\n  Arduino Remote - Receiver Hookup & Code - 29:02\n  Arduino Remote Demo - 32:19

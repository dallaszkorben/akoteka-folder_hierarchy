orig = Today I’ll be introducing two inexpensive LIDAR devices that you can start experimenting with. These devices were provided courtesy of DFRobot, they are VERY inexpensive considering their capabilities. Visit their store at https://www.dfrobot.com/ to see these and other LIDAR units.\n\n\nThe first device is the TF Mini, a simple stationary LIDAR devices that uses a focused infrared beam to accurately measure distances from 30 cm to 12 meters (1 to 40 feet). This compact and easy to use unit contains its own processor and can scan up to 100 times a seconds.\n\nI’ll show you how the TF Mini is configured and how to use it with an Arduino, it makes a great addition to a robot and can outperform the usual ultrasonic sensors in many ways.\n\nThe second device is no less than amazing, it’s the RPLIDAR device from Robo Peak. This s a full 360 degree scanning LIDAR unit, just like you’ve seen on the top of self-driving vehicles. The possibilities in robotics for a device like this are literally endless. \n\nI’ll first test out my RPLIDAR using a PC and some scanning software.  After that I’ll show you the basics of hooking it up to an Arduino and we’ll run a little demo sketch.\n\nHere is what we will be covering today:\n\n  Two LIDAR Devices - 3:30\n  How LIDAR works - 6:08\n  LIDAR vs. other technologies - 9:02\n  TF Mini LIDAR - 12:11\n  Logic Level (Voltage) Converters - 13:52\n  TF Mini with Arduino - 17:23\n  RPLIDAR - 23:37\n  RPLIDAR Scanning Demo - 25:43\n  RPLIDAR with Arduino - 31:40\n\nThis is the first video I’ve done on LIDAR but it will certainly not be the last, nor is it the last time you’ll see these two devices.  I’m intending to do a few more videos to demonstrate the capabilities of both devices so stay tuned.

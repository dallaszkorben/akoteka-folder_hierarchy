[storyline]
orig = Today we are going to look at the somewhat mundane but absolutely essential subject of supplying power for your electronic projects. Trust me, this stuff is important! \n\n\nElectronic devices typically require either 5 or 3.3 volts, sometimes both. Other common voltage requirements include 6 and 12 volts for motors and displays. Some complex designs (ie. a robot) require several different supplies with different current capabilities.\n\nWhen you build your latest robot or IoT device you’ll need to consider how you'll supply these voltages in the real world. On the workbench you can use a bench power supply if you have one, a USB adapter or even the USB port on a computer (just like with the Arduino).\n\nBut when your creation needs to exist on its own with a line-powered or battery power supply you’ll need to figure out how to get all of those voltages delivered to your components, preferably easily and inexpensively.  \n\nI have nine, yes nine methods of doing exactly that. Today I’ll show you a number of different voltage regulators and converters ranging from the classic 7805 3-pin voltage regulator to a tiny device that can supply a steady 5 volts even when your battery is about to die.\n\nCheck out the following Table of Contents to skip ahead to the power supply solution of your choice. Or just sit back and enjoy the show.\n\nINTRO\n\n  Breadboard power supply module - 3:00\n  Power Supply Basics - 6:28\n\nLINEAR REGULATORS\n\n  LM7805 - 5 Volt linear regulator - 11:42\n  LM317 - Variable linear regulator - 14:32\n  PSM-165 - 3.3 Volt linear regulator module - 17:52\n  AMS1117 - 5 Volt linear regulator module - 19:47\n  L4931CZ33-AP - 3.3 volt low voltage-drop regulator - 21:43\n\nVOLTAGE CONVERTERS\n\n  Buck Converter Intro - 23:51\n  MINI-360 - Variable buck converter - 24:41\n  Boost Converter Intro - 26:46\n  PSM-205 - USB boost converter - 27:37\n  MT3608 - Variable boost converter - 29.07\n  Buck Boost Converter Intro - 31:06\n  S9V11F5 - 5 Volt buck boost converter - 33:06\n\nThat last module is the one I was referring to earlier, it really is an amazing device and is perfect for your battery powered projects.

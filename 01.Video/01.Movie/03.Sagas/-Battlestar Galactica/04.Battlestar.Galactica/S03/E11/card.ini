[storyline]
orig = 
en = The Galactica has been harvesting food on the algae planet for some weeks now when Chief Tyrol comes across a cave that indicates it may be the Temple of Five containing a marker, the Eye of Jupiter, left behind by the 13th tribe meant to point the way to Earth. Just as Adama and Roslin are getting an update on the find, four Basestars appear but do not attack. Rather, the Cylons have a proposition for them: give the the Eye of Jupiter and all hostilities will cease. Adama and Roslin agree that under no circumstances will they surrender the find. To complicate matters further, Lt. Gaeta determines that the nearby sun is about to go supernova. Meanwhile, Boomer tells Athena that her baby, Hera, is alive but not well. Neither Athena nor Helo believe it but after getting the truth from Roslin, Adama confirms that it's true.
hu = Az algabolygón Tyrol felfedezi a mitikus templomot, ahol talán megtalálhatják a "Jupiter szemét", amely a legendák szerint megmutatja a Földre vezető utat. A felfedezés a Cylonokat is érdekli. Eközben Athena megtudja, hogy babája, Hera talán mégis életben van.

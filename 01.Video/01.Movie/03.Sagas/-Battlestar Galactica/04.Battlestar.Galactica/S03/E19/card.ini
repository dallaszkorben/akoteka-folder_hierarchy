[storyline]
orig = 
en = President Roslin has a dream where she is chasing Hera in the former opera house on Kobol. Athena and Caprica Six are there with her. Col. Tigh and Sam Anders hear a tune while sitting in Joe's bar but they seem the only ones who can hear it. Later, Presidential assistant Tory Foster hears the same tune. Gaius Baltar's trial is about to begin and he has to deal with a cult following who he considers to be a bunch of crazies. At his trial, the prosecutor points out that 5,197 people died or disappeared on New Caprica. Col. Tigh doesn't exactly help the prosecution when he appears drunk on the stand and eventually admits that he would do and say anything to see Baltar found guilty. Lee proves to be an effective member of the defense team scoring points in his cross-examination of President Roslin. It comes as a high personal cost however.
hu = Baltar bírósági vallomása alapjaiban rengeti meg a flotta stabilitását, miközben Lee segíti Romo Lampkin-t, Baltar védelmében. Bár a Hatos számú elutasítja az efféle hiedelmeket, mégis úgy gondolja, hogy a követők többet tudnak Baltar valós természetéről, mint ő maga. Baltar tárgyalásán később Tight is tanúskodik a felesége, Ellen haláláról...

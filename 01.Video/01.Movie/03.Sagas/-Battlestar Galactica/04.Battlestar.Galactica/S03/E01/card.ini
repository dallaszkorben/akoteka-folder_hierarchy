[storyline]
storyline_en = The Cylons have now been in control of New Caprica for over four months. Gaius Baltar is under their collective thumbs and essentially follows their orders. There is a resistance who set off bombs and do their best to disrupt Cylon activity. Col. Tigh is in prison and despite extensive torture, including the loss of an eye, has told them nothing. His wife Ellen will do anything to secure his release and is soon in a sexual relationship with one of the Cylons, John Cavil. There are mixed feelings among the survivors. Some feel the random acts of violence against their captors serves no useful purpose while others feel it is their duty to resist. Kara Thrace, Starbuck, is being kept prisoner in an apartment of sorts by Leoben Conoy. She too resists but every time she kills him, he is simply re-generated and reappears insisting he will continue to do so until he tells her she loves him. Back on Galactica, Admiral Adama takes his son Lee, Commander of the Battlestar Pegasus, to task for going soft.
storyline_hu = Tigh, Tyrol és Anders vezetésével az ellenállás halálos támadásokat indít a Cylonok ellen Új Capricán. Adama pedig azon gondolkodik, hogy egy mentőakció erejéig visszatérjen-e a Galacticával Új Capricára.

[storyline]
orig = As a result of the most recent suicide bombings, some of the Cylons are now arguing that they need to retaliate. Laura Roslin, among others, is in custody and Gaius Baltar tries to get her to cooperate. Tigh however absolutely refuses to stop the suicide bombings. Nighttime raids also leads to Cally's arrest but they leave her baby alone. Sharon Valerii sees what she can do about it. John Cavil meanwhile tells Ellen Tigh she is to provide the date and location of the next meeting of the resistance commanders. Leoben Conoy is still holding Starbuck prisoner but introduces her to her daughter, Kacey, produced from eggs they harvested from her when she was on the Farm. On Galactica, Admiral Adama begins to plan for a massive rescue of everyone on New Caprica. He realizes they will have to obtain the launch keys for all of the ships on the planet's surface. The best way of infiltrating the Cylons is with another Cylon so Adama commissions Sharon Agathon as an officer.

[storyline]
storyline_en = The Galactica is having a boxing tournament of sorts. As Admiral Adama explains it to President Roslin, the purpose is to let the crew step into the ring and release their frustrations against an opponent of their choice, regardless of rank. As the crew watch or participate the fight, they recall past incidents between them. Adama calls out Chief Tyrol, who he let go live on New Caprica when he really needed him on the ship. He has a message for the crew on duty and obligations. Starbuck and Apollo have a long history together and have never fully comes to terms with their feelings for one another. During the initial establishment of the colony on New Caprica they made love after a drunken wild party and Apollo was ready for them to make a life together. Starbuck refused to accept their need for one another and married Sam Anders the very next day.
storyline_hu = Adama egy boksz bajnokságot rendez a Galaktikán, hogy így vezesse le a legénységben felgyülemlett feszültséget. A versenyláz azonban agresszív meccshez vezet Kara és Lee közt. Az Új Caprica-i visszatekintések felfedik ellentétük eredetét.

[storyline]
orig = Everyone is having to come to terms with the death of Starbuck. The Admiral reviews her file in tears and Sam Anders gets drunk but Apollo can't quite bring himself to place her photo on the wall of dead crewmen, as he had promised. Preparations are being finalized for Gaius Baltar's trial and Admiral Adama is one of 5 people selected at random to serve on the tribunal. As Tom Zarek had predicted however there is violence with Baltar's attorney is killed. His new attorney is Romo Lampkin and it's only by chance that Chief Tyrol uncovers a bomb meant to kill the lawyer. The Admiral puts his son Lee in charge of Lampkin's security but the two don't exactly see eye to eye on what that means. For Lee, it means ensuring that the disgraced ex-President gets a fair trial and his revived interest in the law leads him to become more involved.

[storyline]

en = Admiral Adama is playing a deadly serious game of chicken with the Cylons. Nuclear missiles are armed and Adama seems ready to destroy the planet if the Cylons don't relent. The Cylons are concerned about Number 3's independence and refusal to follow an order from the group. It becomes clear that D'Anna Biers isn't much interested in the Eye of Jupiter but wants to see the Final 5. She gets her wish but they are clearly not what she was expecting. On the algae planet, Apollo orders Dee to mount a rescue mission for Starbuck whose Raptor was shot down. Inside the temple, Tyrol continues his efforts to find the Eye of Jupiter. Athena is determined to get her baby back and knows one way to get aboard the Cylon Basestar.

[storyline]
orig = 
en = On the day of James T. Kirk's birth, his father dies on his damaged starship in a last stand against a Romulan mining vessel looking for Ambassador Spock, who in this time, has grown on Vulcan disdained by his neighbors for his half-human heritage. 25 years later, James T. Kirk has grown into a young rebellious troublemaker. Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy academy instructors like Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency on Vulcan and the newly-commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever as a new version of the legend begins.
hu = Az iowai farmerfiú, Kirk, és a félig ember, félig vulkáni Spock nem is különbözhetnének jobban. A feszültság csak egyre nő, amikor az egész Föderációt elpusztítani vágyó ellenséggel kell szembenézniük. A galaxis megmentése érdekében azonban össze kell fogniuk, ha meg akarják állítani a Balokk nevű idegent.

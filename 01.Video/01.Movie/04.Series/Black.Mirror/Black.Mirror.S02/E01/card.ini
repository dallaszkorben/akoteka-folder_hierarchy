[storyline]

en = Martha is devastated when her partner Ash is killed in an accident the day they planned to move in together. At Ash's funeral, Martha's friend tells her of a new service which enables people to communicate with their (deceased) loved one. Martha is appalled, and decides to stay in the cottage despite her sister's view she is isolating herself. One day Martha gets a message from Ash, and she realises Sarah has signed her up for the service. Initially, Martha's displeased but, on finding she's pregnant, relents and son begins communicating now and more with 'Ash'. With her comfort-level growing talking with the synthetic Ash, it isn't long before 'he' tells Martha about a 'next level' of communicating - one which will bring them truly closer.

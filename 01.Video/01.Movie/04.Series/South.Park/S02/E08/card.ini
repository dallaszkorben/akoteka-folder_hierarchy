Jimbo and Ned decide to head south and buy fireworks in Mexico, while the Mayor decides to exploit a loophole in the law (which still allows "snakes") by building the world's largest snake for the town's July 4 celebration. When the resulting snake becomes so large that it threatens to destroy everything, only a miracle can save the town.

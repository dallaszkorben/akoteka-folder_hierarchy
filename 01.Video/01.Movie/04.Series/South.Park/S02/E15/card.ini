[storyline]
storyline_en = Stan's mother is getting a visit from her Aunt Flo, who gives Stan a pet fish as a present. Something doesn't seem right about the fish, though, and soon dead bodies start turning up in Stan's room. Though Stan tries to convince his mother that the fish did it, she assumes that her son is a murderer and begins hiding the bodies in the backyard. Meanwhile, Cartman starts acting strangely, sometimes wearing a goatee and acting unusually nice, other times looking and acting like his obnoxious self. Somehow, these events are all related.
storyline_hu = Egy párhuzamos világból különös teremtmények érkeznek South Parkba, többek között Cartman barátságosabb változata és egy gyilkos aranyhal.

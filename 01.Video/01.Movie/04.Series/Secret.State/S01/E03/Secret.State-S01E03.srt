19
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,799
The government of Iran is accusing us

20
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,879
of carrying out
an act of war against them.

21
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,119
The price of oil is spiking as a
result.

22
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,839
Unemployment is high and rising.

23
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,159
The UK economy is increasingly
fragile

24
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,159
and we still don't know
what's happened to Charles Flyte.

25
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,519
I can think of one word
we might use, Mr Speaker.

26
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,519
Chaos.
Hear, hear!

27
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,999
First of all,
let me state this quite clearly.

28
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,959
We have not committed
any act of war against Iran.

29
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,519
And on the subject of the
investigation into the plane crash,

30
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,799
both the Royal Navy and the United
States Navy are involved

31
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,639
in the search for the flight
recorder.

32
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,639
And without it, it's not possible
with any degree of certainty...

33
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,159
Mr Speaker, perhaps the Prime
Minister would care to comment

34
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,919
on the news just reaching us

35
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,919
that PetroFex is said to be on the
verge of relocating to Poland?

36
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,079
Order. Order!

37
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,319
They're citing Government hostility
and the danger of further sabotage.

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,799
And they've suspended
their offer of compensation

39
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,759
for the destruction at Scarrow.

40
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,279
But I could barely get Clark
to admit that he'd made it.

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,839
Clark claims that your ambush at the
airport demonstrates a campaign

42
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,879
to undermine the company's standing.

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,879
Bollocks!

44
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,759
All right.

45
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,879
You get hold of Michael Rix
at Royal Caledonian.

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,279
I'm going to freeze their fucking
assets

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,879
until we decide the level of
compensation.

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,879
Call Rix.

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,799
You mentioned sabotage?

50
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,239
Well, they say they've got evidence
of Dermot Matthews

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,239
making an unauthorised entry to the
plant just prior to the explosion.

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,559
Hello?

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,439
'Ellis, you're still in touch
with Jade Matthews, I believe.'

54
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,239
Yeah. Listen, I've just tried my luck
with the Chief of Defence Staff.

55
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,719
Surprise, surprise,
he didn't want to talk to me.

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,759
'What about?'

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,279
About drone fuel. What else?

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,519
'Look, about the Matthews family...'

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,439
PetroFex are claiming that her
husband may have committed an act of
sabotage.

60
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,999
Can you have a word with her
and see what she knows?

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,079
All right. Then you and me
are going to sit down

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,839
and have this interview for this
profile. Is that the deal?

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,119
Yes, yes. Yes, thank you.

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,719
Bye-bye.

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,719
Whose idea was it to throw the
Iranians out of their embassy?

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,279
(..The company you keep...)

67
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,079
Prime Minister.

68
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,079
General, I thought I'd made it clear
that you'd been relieved of your
post.

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,919
This will be my final briefing,
Prime Minister.

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,399
Now, it's in Afghanistan or it's in
Iran.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,399
Which is it?

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,399
The border there has historically
been slightly ill-defined.

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,639
The topography means
that it's hard to be precise.

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,439
Can I ask why not one of you

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,439
even mentioned the proximity
of the border before?

76
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,679
The drones are programmed to alert us
to any territorial infringements.

77
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,439
Ah. Then it can't
have crossed the border?

78
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,759
There's...a small possibility

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,799
that the missile did.

80
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,359
I stress, a small possibility.

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,119
Now, it is election time in Iran.
In all probability,

82
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,119
the hard-liners are sabre-rattling
for electoral advantage.

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,239
They'd be fools making a claim like
that without foundation.

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,879
They'd look bigger fools if we showed them
what a real act of war looked like.

85
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,399
Might do the modernisers a favour -
a well-placed Cruise missile or two.

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,399
Is that why they stopped?

87
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,239
Because they thought they were safe?

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,759
They stopped to pray.

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,759
Because they believed
they were safe, across the border?

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,879
Is that it?

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,959
Prime Minister...

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,559
Do we have men on the ground there?

93
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,559
We've got Special Ops not far away,
but, um...

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,199
But they can check it out...

95
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,199
if it's on the wrong side
of the fucking border?

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,679
Good luck.

97
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,119
You'll need it, believe me.

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,119
And how's the search
for the black box going, General?

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
It's very deep there, Prime Minister.

100
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,199
The ocean.

101
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,999
We're going to play this down.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,799
The Iranians will want to build it
up.

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,799
That's not going to happen.

104
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,679
I can't stand stainless steel.
It's like pissing in a lift.

105
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,679
Do that a lot, do you, Felix?

106
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,119
Paul Clark, um...

107
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,119
..he says there's nothing we can do
to stop them going to Poland.

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,039
The bank, they've...
they've frozen the assets?

109
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,399
Christ!

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,239
Sir Michael...

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,559
Prime Minister. My flight to Davos
is in less than two hours.

112
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,559
Understood. Please, take a seat.

113
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,319
You're in a hurry and neither of us
has anything to hide.

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,359
Please.

115
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,519
So, where have you put the money,
Sir Michael?

116
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,879
We're discussing the PetroFex
account?

117
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,879
You've disappeared their assets.

118
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,919
A multinational like PetroFex
has constant call on its holding.

119
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,639
Capital is a very mobile resource
these days, and for good reason.

120
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,359
They needed the money somewhere else
and you shifted it for them.

121
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,679
It's a click of the mouse,
no great strength required.

122
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,719
You didn't think it odd
that they would suddenly want

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,639
to expatriate
nearly three billion in sterling?

124
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,159
We're a bank.

125
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,519
We act under instruction.

126
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,079
We perform our fiduciary duty.

127
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,719
But you knew, and you personally.

128
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,719
This mouse click wasn't done
by Trevor in Accounts.

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,359
Your bank is the company's
biggest shareholder, am I right?

130
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,999
That much you can read
in the company prospectus.

131
00:07:39,1000 --> 00:07:41,519
And as their biggest shareholder,

132
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,519
you'd expect to have influence
over their major decisions?

133
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,519
I'm going to be late.

134
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,039
Do you know
who the company prospectus gives

135
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,319
as your bank's biggest shareholder,
Sir Michael?

136
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,319
Me. The British Government.
The British people.

137
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,079
And what we'd like you to do
is click that little mouse

138
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,839
and repatriate that three billion.

139
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,479
That's not how the world works,
Prime Minister.

140
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,479
Then maybe we need to address that
too.

141
00:08:14,1000 --> 00:08:18,959
Tom? Your alfresco summit's
got Twitter all aflutter!

142
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,159
Did you speak to Jade Matthews?

143
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
I'll tell you when I get back from
Davos.

144
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,239
'God, the whole world is in Davos.'

145
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,759
Well, Paul Clark is, anyway.

146
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,039
Well, I don't think
he's going to talk to you.

147
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,679
'That's not what he told me.'

148
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,119
So... So what did she say?

149
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,839
'The cab's here.'

150
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,639
Dermot had an accident at work
about a year ago.

151
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,399
He was inside one of the fuel tanks
cleaning it when it started to fill
up.

152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,159
'He nearly drowned in the stuff.'

153
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,599
The drone fuel?

154
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,599
'Yeah. He wasn't a saboteur, Tom.
I can tell you that much.'

155
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,159
'And you're still trying to speak
to General Munnery?'

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,159
'I've got to go.
I'll speak to you soon.'

157
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,719
Ellis Kane. What do you know about
her?

158
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,559
Are you sleeping with her, Tom?

159
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,079
I'd love to know
where you think I get the time.

160
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,199
Apologies for dispensing
with the niceties.

161
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,359
She's the sort of woman
men like to impress.

162
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,599
Men like you.

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,079
Is she?

164
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,079
Yes. Tough, independent,
knowledgeable.

165
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,079
Thank you.

166
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,079
Like all journalists,
she only cares about one thing.

167
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,119
The story.

168
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,359
No, it's a consequence
of... Michael...listen to me!

169
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,319
Er, vodka and tonic, please.

170
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,159
Er, vodka and tonic, please.
Sure.

171
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,519
The failure of the banking system
as a whole.

172
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,759
Someone to shoot your mouth off to,
right?

173
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,759
I think you should keep your mouth
shut.

174
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,439
Did she give you
special dispensation, Tom?

175
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,439
Face time with the disreputable
Mr Fossett?

176
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,439
Trouble in paradise?

177
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,439
You're early.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,039
I told you something once.

179
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,159
About Bosnia.

180
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,679
You did.

181
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,519
Just wondering...

182
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,159
if it's out there?

183
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,959
Why?

184
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,479
General Munnery. Things he said.

185
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,519
Such as?

186
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,399
And a journalist.

187
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,079
Always trouble.

188
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,359
Talking to him.

189
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,399
Well, trying to.

190
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,399
And you're wondering
if I've been indiscreet?

191
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,279
Well, you are the one
who told me about Nightlight.

192
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,119
In confidence.

193
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,119
Are you so sure about what you say
and what you don't say these days?

194
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,999
Excuse me?

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,359
Drop the indignation.
I don't have time for it.

196
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,719
Aren't we high and mighty these
days?

197
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,719
You keep pushing that, don't you?

198
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,199
Not guilty. Can I go now, please,
Prime Minister?

199
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,839
Maybe you should stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,397
You could die a bitter old drunk.

201
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,059
We'll have to start
charging you rent, Tony.

202
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,299
If you're taking up residence.

203
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,219
What's that?

204
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,939
A leggy blonde came in
in a flame-red, polka-dot dress.

205
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,139
Said she had a penchant
for maudlin drunks.

206
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,979
Hang on, sorry, I'm mistaken.

207
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,059
It was a brown-eyed girl,
sort of clever-looking.

208
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,059
Mind you, I quite like that.
I quite like a clever one.

209
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,859
Excuse me!

210
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,219
Bad influence, am I? Is that it?

211
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,659
Good night, Tony.

212
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,659
I'm not allowed
on little Tommy's trampoline?

213
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,699
Come on... Where?

214
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,459
Make a fool of me? Huh?

215
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,179
Ah. Yeah?

216
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,619
Come on, come on.

217
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,619
Argh!

218
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,219
Where is it? Where would you put...?

219
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,219
All this time!

220
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,899
Think. Think!

221
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,899
Come on...

222
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,459
Agh!

223
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,819
Your company put Dermot Matthews
on a bonus package,

224
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,939
provided he kept quiet
about an accident.

225
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,819
You promised to take care of his
family and assigned him a doctor,

226
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,099
so if he did have
any health problems,

227
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,939
he could keep them in-house.

228
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,939
Dermot went to his GP, though,
and his GP asked him

229
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,259
to get hold of a sample of the stuff
that he nearly drowned in.

230
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,339
According to Jade,

231
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,499
the only reason why he was there
the day of the explosion

232
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,979
is because
he was going to get that sample.

233
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,539
That's a good story.

234
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,059
But I can get you a better one.

235
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,339
What do you mean,
you can get me a better one?

236
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,019
"Tom Dawkins, the Army Years."

237
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,339
Get this lady a drink.

238
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,859
Aaaaarrggh!

239
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,979
Chaos on the Tube and gridlock
threatened on the roads this morning

240
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,299
as the underground networks
in London, Newcastle and Glasgow

241
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,019
suffer a total shutdown.

242
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,019
In other news this morning, the
markets opened significantly lower...

243
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,179
The Tube companies are saying

244
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,179
their bank won't sanction Oyster
transactions or card payments.

245
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,579
If they open the gates,
it'll be mayhem.

246
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,499
Which bank?

247
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,099
RCB.

248
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,099
RCB.
You're joking.

249
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,979
Get Felix in here.

250
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,899
Tell Gina Hayes to pass it off
as a bank blunder

251
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,899
before they start to blame us.

252
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,859
They'll be cackling
into their croissants in Davos.

253
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,539
Any news from Iran?

254
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,059
It's gone quiet.

255
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,379
Small mercies.

256
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,539
Oh, Lee...

257
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,539
Ros Yelland?

258
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,819
What about her?

259
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,459
Can you get her to come and see me

260
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,459
before she meets
the Iranian Foreign Minister?

261
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,219
Hear that?

262
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,379
Ah, Felix.

263
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,379
What can you tell me?

264
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,059
I had a word with Sir Michael.

265
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,019
Really?
I was told that he was in a meeting.

266
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,699
He's looking into it.

267
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,219
How welldoyou know him?

268
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,219
Our wives are very good friends,
on the same charity board.

269
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,139
Oh.

270
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,219
Well, coincidence or otherwise,

271
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,699
I bollock him
about the PetroFex assets

272
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,899
and the following day,
his bank paralyses the Tube system.

273
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,939
Tom...

274
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,939
Perhaps you could have
your wife askhiswife.

275
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,179
You're going to have to go back
to the Bank of England, Felix.

276
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,099
I want them to guarantee the
underground companies' transactions,

277
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,379
so that we can get
the trains moving again.

278
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,699
You know what the Governor will say.

279
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,179
The Bank of England
is independent of Government.

280
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,299
Well, if RCB wants
to throw its weight around,

281
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,019
they've got to understand
that we can fight back.

282
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,419
But RCB will have this sorted before
the Bank of England's even out of
first gear.

283
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,139
Tube's up and running.

284
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,739
Rush hour's over.

285
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,019
It's a gentle poke
in the bloody ribs.

286
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,219
We need resolution, Tom, on Iran

287
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,139
and on this spat
with the Royal Caledonian.

288
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,139
The pound's already under pressure
and now RCB's dumping sterling.

289
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,779
And then what?

290
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,659
The Bank of England will sell
foreign reserves to prop it up.

291
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,659
But it won't last for ever.

292
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,819
Right.

293
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,859
Sound out the IMF.

294
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,859
Say that I want to talk
about underwriting sterling.

295
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,699
Well, they want their pound of flesh

296
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,459
and they want you
to lay off the banks.

297
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,419
And you should issue an apology.

298
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,419
I'll talk to Rix.

299
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,419
He's in Davos.

300
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,839
Have you got that package?

301
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,079
I thought it was a
bit early for you.

302
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,679
Have you?

303
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,879
Have you?
All right, don't panic.

304
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,319
Does that thing work?

305
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,319
Just do the coffee.

306
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,679
Is this a good place to be
if you're not drinking?

307
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,679
I'm drinking coffee...or I would be
if you'd hurry the fuck up.

308
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,959
Makes some people tetchy, Tony,
going on the wagon.

309
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,959
But you must be the exception.

310
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,879
Just go easy. That's all.

311
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,959
We're playing the long game.

312
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,959
You go easy too, this time.
With Rix.

313
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,319
Since we're handing out advice.

314
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,439
Your Wi-Fi's rubbish.

315
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,439

drinking.

might once have had an affair

324
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,879
with his wife's sister?

325
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,919
How's that going to help me?

326
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,039
I'm not suggesting you mention it.

327
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,039
And what will his secret service
be telling him about me?

328
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,279
That you're sleeping
with the Prime Minister's PPS?

329
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,799
That you rate your chances
very highly,

330
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,999
should Tom Dawkins self-destruct?

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,999
The chances of which
seem to be increasing by the hour.

332
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,719
Oh, that's clever.

333
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,999
That's very clever.

334
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,319
What you found?

335
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,399
I've found a battery...

336
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,399
..where no battery's
supposed to be.

337
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,119
Show this to your opposite number...
if an opportunity arises.

338
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,839
Who is it?

339
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,919
His name's Sami Sharour.

340
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,639
He was on the plane
with Charles Flyte.

341
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,159
And, er...

342
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,159
..he may have been working
for the Iranians.

343
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,079
Sir?What?

344
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,919
The biometric database
has been compromised.

345
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,359
And you're telling me why?

346
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,359
Because the subject
was Sami Sharour.

347
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,079
Apparently there
was a lack of clarity

348
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,679
over which assets
you wanted frozen.

349
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,679
The...knock-on effect impacted
on the tube company's systems.

350
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,079
Tom...

351
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,799
I'm, um...

352
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,839
Ros Yelland.

353
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,239
I know.

354
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,639
What's the arrangement?

355
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,799
Well, we...chat and...

356
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,679
Chat?

357
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,679
You whisper sweet nothings in her ear
about what I'm doing?

358
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,959
Get your phone out. Call her.

359
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,119
Tell her that I know...

360
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,519
and that you're saying goodbye.

361
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,519
Or you find someone else to work for.

362
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,439
So the waiter thinks, "Hang on,

363
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,439
"I won't give him back
the whole fiver.

364
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,479
"I'll give the three of them
?1 each."

365
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,839
So the three diners
have spent ?9 each, right?

366
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,879
So the three diners
have spent ?9 each, right?
Right.

367
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,839
Which is ?27, yeah?

368
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,199
Right.

369
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,199
The waiter pockets two, right?

370
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,239
Right.

371
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,519
So, that's 29. So, where's the other
pound gone? There was 30.

372
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,519
Michael, just discreetly stick this
laptop under the counter, would you?

373
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,319
You any good at maths?

374
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,319
Then he asked for a vodka martini,
which is pretty rare these days.

375
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,359
Looked a bit like, um...
What's his name?

376
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,119
I'm off.Oh, here...

377
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,119
Don't be leaving
your stamp album here again.

378
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,639
Philatelist!

379
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,119
Mr Foreign Minister,
good to meet you.

380
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,119
I wonder if you know who that is?

381
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,639
Should I?

382
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,479
We're all in.

383
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,479
Michael, the last time
that we met at Downing Street,

384
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,479
I was...

385
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,239
"Michael" or "Sir Michael"?

386
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,879
Sir Michael, of course. Jesus.

387
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,879
Sir Michael, the last time
that we met at Downing Street,

388
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,719
I was perhaps a little...

389
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,959
What?

390
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,199
Intemperate?

391
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,239
Intemperate. Perfect.

392
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,239
Yes, may the good Lord in his wisdom
preserve us from the intemperate.

393
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,399
Steel yourselves.

394
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,759
Tom, the Ros thing...

395
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,759
It's forgotten, Lee.

396
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,679
Have you lost interest
in this profile?

397
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,439
We were actually
just getting ready...

398
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,439
We were actually
just getting ready...
Sorry, Tom, I really need
to talk to you.

399
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,279
Does he know
something about you, Tom?

400
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,279
Because...
that's what I'm being told.

401
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,479
Do you know what this job is like?

402
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,359
It's like being under the knife
without anaesthetic, 24/7.

403
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,399
So give me your version.

404
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,399
There is no version.

405
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,759
I've... I've nothing to tell you.

406
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,199
This is your chance, Tom.

407
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,959
There is no story.

408
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,359
I can see it in your eyes.

409
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,359
There's nothing there.

410
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,042
Now, if you'll excuse me...

411
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,899
Do you think, Sir Michael,
that my intemperance

412
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,899
has contributed to the
destabilisation of the markets?

413
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,859
Vulture funds are almost
certainly playing
silly buggers in the CDS market.

414
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,139
The people of the United Kingdom have
poured 50 billion into your bank.

415
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,219
Do you think that merits any kind of
consideration of the public interest?

416
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,699
In an ideal world I'd agree,

417
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,699
but I'm afraid the bank
has only one duty.

418
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,819
To act in the shareholders'
interests.

419
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,779
Oh, good.

420
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,299
We represent 88% of them.

421
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,579
All the shareholders.

422
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,579
Politics is parochial,
Prime Minister. Finance is global.

423
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,579
Yes, but you're headquartered
in my jurisdiction.

424
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,059
Oh, we could up and go tomorrow.

425
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,059
You see, that's the kind
of remark that stokes
my intemperance, Sir Michael.

426
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,539
You invested 50 billion...

427
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,659
..and OK, granted, that buys you
some influence with my bank,

428
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,339
but what I'm saying is,

429
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,339
if you were to press that case,
we'd get very jittery.

430
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,299
And so would the rest of the banks.

431
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,939
And if we're jittery,
our share price falls.

432
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,979
And if our share price falls,

433
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,979
your 50 billion investment
goes down the toilet.

434
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,379
And any influence you might have had
over the bank goes with it.

435
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,699
So you're saying that we
have influence

436
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,979
so long as
we don't expect to use it?

437
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,979
If you like.

438
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,299
Ah, Mr Mukerjee.

439
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,579
Prime Minister.
Please, call me Tom.

440
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,019
Then it's Jitin.

441
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,019
I... I read your report.

442
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,459
Our two countries
have a long history together.

443
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,459
Yes, they do.

444
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,459
And a very amicable future,
I would have said.

445
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,379
Are we going to get
our hands dirty, Tom?

446
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,299
I've decided you're on my side.

447
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,299
Everyone else might have given up on
me, but I've still got, well...

448
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,779
..you.

449
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,179
So if I understand you right...

450
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,179
..you're wondering if this fella
here, Sami Sharour...

451
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,739
..was on the fatal flight
with our ex-Prime Minister.

452
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,059
And you're wondering...

453
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,739
..why he wasn't on the manifest.

454
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,339
And I presume you're also wondering

455
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,339
if he had something to do
with the plane going down.

456
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,699
So...

457
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,019
something you might not know...

458
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,019
There's a history of fundamentalism
in his family.

459
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,979
Apparently not him, though.

460
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,099
And he was...

461
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,819
He was arrested in 2011

462
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,819
for throwing a rock through
the window of a New York madrasah.

463
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,419
What the CIA would probably call...

464
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,419
.."links with radical Islam".

465
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,019
I'm only doing this for you.

466
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,059
You've come to hear me talk
on the mission's criteria,

467
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,059
but first, a few words from the
British Prime Minister, Tom Dawkins.

468
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,219
Good evening.

469
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,899
I'm hearing a lot about banks
upping sticks

470
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,339
and leaving the City of London,

471
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,339
no doubt to a financial centre
near you.

472
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,619
But before you welcome them with
open arms, I want you to remember

473
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,699
that it was the British people...

474
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,699
..who ploughed tens of billions
into these banks in 2008.

475
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,579
In return for this bailout,

476
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,459
they promised that they
would lend to small businesses.

477
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,459
Well, did they lend to small
businesses like they promised?

478
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,739
Excuse my French, but did they fuck!

479
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,139
'So...

480
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,299
'there's something in these photos
that you didn't see,

481
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,299
'clever as you are.

482
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,499
'I've decided you're on my side.

483
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,499
'Everyone else might have given up
on me, but I've still got, well...

484
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,619
'you.'

485
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,059
What you missed was the bottle.

486
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,899
First, it was in the baggage truck.

487
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,819
Then it wasn't.

488
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,819
And then it was.

489
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,739
So...

490
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,739
Did that harm it, did that damage
it, falling off like that?

491
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,699
What was in it?
Some of that drone fuel?

492
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,899
Why?

493
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,299
Any thoughts...

494
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,259
clever girl?

495
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,619
Who's there?

496
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,499
Ugh!

497
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,699
'He was arrested in 2011

498
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,699
'for throwing a rock through
the window of a New York madrasah.

499
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,699
'What the CIA would probably call...

500
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,699
'.."links with radical Islam". '

501
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,579
'I'm only doing this for you.'

502
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,499
And I've been told that
if I meddle in the affairs
of the Royal Caledonian Bank,

503
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,219
I'm going to jeopardise
the national shareholding.

504
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,659
But it seems to me that
the national shareholding

505
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,179
is valueless for the foreseeable
future,

506
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,899
so here's what I'm going to do.

507
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,699
I propose to buy up the remaining
shares and transform the bank

508
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,459
into an engine of prosperity...

509
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,739
..promoting business,
particularly small business,

510
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,739
and generate employment,
especially among young people.

511
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,179
Where's your phone, Tony?

512
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,179
An Englishman's home is his castle.
You can't just barge in.

513
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,299
Where is it?

514
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,699
What's going on
at the back of my head?

515
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,699
It's...

516
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,539
You've broken my fucking skull,

517
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,099
you animal... Ugh!

518
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,699
'Who's there?

519
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,819
'Ugh!'

520
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,739
'Ugh!'

521
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,899
'What did I ever do to you?'

522
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,899
Ugh!

523
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,499
Aagh...

524
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,139
Tell me where the phone is.

525
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,179
Agh!

526
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,659
Arrgh!

527
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,459
'No, no! No!'

528
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,099
Ughh!

529
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,179
Your phone.

530
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,699
Aargh!

531
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,499
Tony? 

532
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,219
What's going on in there?

533
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,339
Are you all right? 

534
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,379
Arrgh!

535
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,379
Shall I call the police? 

536
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,899
I'm gonna call the police. 

537
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,339
So, in the event that the pound
comes under further attack,

538
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,699
I have arranged with my friends
in the Indian government

539
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,219
to underwrite sterling.

540
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,539
And to the IMF I say,
sorry to disappoint,

541
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,859
but we won't be needing
you after all.

542
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,539
But in return for what? 

543
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,539
That's a very good question. 

544
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,419
Clever as you are, you know...

545
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,219
..if you've spotted it,
someone else has too.

546
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,579
So, the question is,

547
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,579
why don't they say
something about it?

548
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,579
I'll tell Tommy...like you wanted.

549
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,419
Huh?

550
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,419
We'll show him what we can do,
the two of us.

551
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,379
He's going to need
all the help you can get.

552
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,659
Are you listening?

553
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,099
Are you?

554
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,739
India has a 300-year supply of coal

555
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,739
and 400 million people
without electricity.

556
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,859
They need power, now, nationwide.

557
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,779
The United Kingdom
has two million people unemployed,

558
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,539
a world-leading role
in renewables technology,

559
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,539
and, as of today, a bank
dedicated to putting those people

560
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,299
and that technology to work.

561
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,299
The new Royal Caledonian Bank
will fund on a massive scale.

562
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,659
Yes, on a massive scale.

563
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,659
A joint British and Indian research,
development and production project

564
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,179
based in the United Kingdom

565
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,179
with the sole aim
of creating a renewable alternative

566
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,659
to the Indian reliance on coal.

567
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,579
At the same time,
the United Kingdom will withdraw

568
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,579
from all international agreements
coercing India

569
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,219
into fixed timetables
on climate change reduction

570
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,939
until they have achieved
national electrification.

571
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:15,059
He needs to know what we...found.

572
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,459
Tommy does.

573
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,099
I need to know you're listening.

574
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,139
Are you?

575
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,899
Clever girl.

576
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,939
What do you know?

577
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,339
Did you give it to him?

578
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,859
I can tell you what happened
to Tony, but I can't talk now.

579
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,179
There'll be someone monitoring
this phone.

580
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,179
You're suggesting he was an agent
of the Iranian government?

581
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,779
The press are digging. MI6, CIA.

582
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,299
Forget about the flight recorder.

583
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,139
Begins to look pretty compelling.

584
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,939
Prime Minister, you're in great
danger.

585
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,779
They've come for me.
Stop right there!

586
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,339
350 years of continuous trading

587
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,979
and shifting your fucking assests is
bringing my bank to its knees.

588
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,179
Tom served in
the British Army in Bosnia.

589
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,019
Might have been an idea to tell me
about the skeleton in your closet.

590
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,619
We can't sit on secrets like that.

591
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,219
This is misinformation.
This is bullshit.

592
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,659
Does everyone in this country want
a war with Iran?

593
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,739
Come into the Chamber now
and announce retaliation

594
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,739
or come in there and resign.

9999
-1:59:07,700 --> -1:59:09,200

22
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,289
Well, I...I haven't done anything
to deserve this yet, but...

23
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,369
thank you so much.

24
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,289
Let's be frank. There isn't another
person here who could have pulled
this off, hmm?

25
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,689
It was tight,
but we are still in government.

26
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,329
If you're at the table,

27
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,729
you owe this man your job!

28
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,080
you owe this man your job!
Hear, hear!

29
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,009
Well, the good news is that
the country still believes in us.

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,529
Obviously, there's a great deal
of work to be done.

31
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,889
Just one word of caution before
we all get our sleeves rolled up.

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,529
Briefly.

33
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,009
Tom scored a lot of points in the
election with the way he spoke out

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,169
against the excesses
of big business.

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,769
No-one would disagree.

36
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,769
But that was electioneering.
This is government.

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,849
Meaning?

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,849
Meaning...
let's remember who our friends are.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,889
Yes, by all means,
let's remember who our friends are.

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,889
But let's also remember
the people who voted for us.

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,209
Don't pull your ear
when you're agitated.

42
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,849
And if your hands are going to shake,
keep them on the podium.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,849
Remember, stay on the road
and don't mention the scenery.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,600
Yes?

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,169
What's the latest on the flight
recorder

46
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,329
from Charles Flyte's plane,
Prime Minister?

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,889
It hasn't been found.

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,769
Surely there's something to report.
It's been three weeks now.

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,169
If there was something to tell,
I would tell you.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,689
With respect,

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,009
a lot of times government does know
but doesn't tell.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,769
Not this government.

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,809
Phrases That Will Come Back
To Haunt Him - number one.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,160
Tweeting, Ros?

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,009
Tweeting, Ros?
Don't you follow me?

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,849
The PM's aide, Sayed Khan
- his cousin was released last week.

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,689
Does that mean that area
of the investigation is closed?

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,489
Sayed Khan was a trusted member of
the late Prime Minister's advisory
team.

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,489
So why did he email his cousin
details of Charles Flyte's plane?

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,609
He was an aeroplane geek,
and his cousin was, too.

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,809
You can scoff, but it's true.

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,809
And the doubts
about the plane's safety record?

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,329
That model
doesn't have an exemplary record,

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,369
but without the black box,
we are in no...

65
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,849
On the black box,

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,369
will the Americans be making all
their findings available to you?

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,720
Why wouldn't they?

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,969
Why wouldn't they?
Number two! So soon.

69
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,009
What's happening with Scarrow,
Prime Minister?

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,609
You said you're pressing
for the highest compensation.

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,049
The HSE report is now imminent.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,049
As you know, I have appointed Lord
Justice Holbeck to chair the public
inquiry.

73
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,569
He's the man. What he says goes.
He says, "Jump," we jump.

74
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,849
And that includes you, too,
by the way, Nightlight.

75
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,769
Will Lord Holbeck be looking

76
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,129
into the circumstances
of the pathologist's death?

77
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,129
Into his suicide? Yes.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,729
The pathologist was
an honourable man

79
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,169
doing a trying job
in difficult circumstances.

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,929
The treatment he received was,
in my opinion, quite shameful.

81
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,289
Is it true you spoke to him
the day he died?

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,449
Is it true you spoke to him
the day he died?
Yes.

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,769
And I know that there were
toxicology anomalies...

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,249
And I know that there were
toxicology anomalies...
Toxicology anomalies?

85
00:04:08,1000 --> 00:04:11,129
When will Lord Holbeck
make his findings available?

86
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,129
Will there be a
statement from the coroner's office?

87
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,129
I'm asking the Lord Justice to look
into them, and why they created
such an impasse

88
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,089
between the company
and the coroner's office.

89
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,440
What about the Scarrow Inquiry?

90
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,720
What about the Scarrow Inquiry?
No more questions.

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,049
Thank you for your patience.
Good afternoon.

92
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,329
What happened to "stay on the road
and don't mention the scenery"?

93
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,409
No harm in putting some heat
under the story.

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,769
It may focus a few minds
at PetroFex.

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,649
Yes, this is Richard Head here.

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,969
I'm calling from Lord Holbeck's
team.

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,320
'The Scarrow Inquiry?'

98
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,409
'The Scarrow Inquiry?'
'That's right, the inquiry.'

99
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,529
'You may've heard the Prime Minister

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,369
'say we'd be looking into the death
of Dr Ashcroft, the pathologist.'

101
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,720
'Awful...'

102
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,009
'Awful...'
Oh, yes. Terrible. Erm...

103
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,009
so we're going to need hard copies
of all his emails,

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,880
going back six weeks.

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,209
'Hard copies. All of them?'

106
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,049
Well, you heard the Prime Minister
say

107
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,289
he wanted a swift resolution
to all this.

108
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,809
'Yes, but hard copies
could take days.'

109
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,649
Well, if you really think it'll take
that long, send them by email.

110
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,969
It'll do for now,
but it's not very satisfactory.

111
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,409
'To what address?'

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,409
Er,
richard.head@holbeckinquiry.co.uk.

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,160
'Should we cc anyone else?'

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,249
'Should we cc anyone else?'
No, thank you.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,249
Don't look at me like that.

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,409
I'll arrange a statement
regarding the pathologist.

117
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,889
I'll arrange a statement
regarding the pathologist.
OK.

118
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,449
Do you read Ros Yelland's tweets?

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,009
Do I look like somebody
who reads tweets?

120
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,009
Maybe you should start.

121
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,529
Paul Clark. Try him again.

122
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,880
Track him down.

123
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,249
Two words - coal minister.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,049
Two words - coal minister.
OK.

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,249
Hello.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,529
So did he kill himself?

127
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,969
It would seem so.

128
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,969
And do you believe that?

129
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,849
Yes.

130
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,089
Congratulations, by the way.

131
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,089
Does your ascendancy mean I now have
an inside man at Number 10?

132
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,169
I recall you telling me
it wasn't going to happen.

133
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,969
And you telling me not to believe
what I read in the papers.

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,689
And what are we going to read
in the papers?

135
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,209
Since we're getting on so famously,
I've been told I can do a profile.

136
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,209
Your first 30 days.

137
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,560
Really?

138
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,529
Really.

139
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,489
Is this you?

140
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,569
You've been doing your research.

141
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,249
It's Bosnia in 1992.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,129
And you were where else?

143
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,769
Ulster. Germany.

144
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,769
That's you and...?

145
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,889
Look, have we got time to talk?

146
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,489
No, I'm afraid we don't.
I've got a very important meeting

147
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,249
with the Indian Minister for Coal.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,249
It's a shame.

149
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,729
Please, go ahead.

150
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,649
I have wet wipes here.

151
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,649
Let's get our hands dirty.

152
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,049
This coal provided
the underground boiler room

153
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,729
that made this nation what it is
today.

154
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,449
And yet, what do you say to us?

155
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,449
Leave our coal where it is.
The planet can't take it.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,649
"You've reached Tom Dawkins.
Leave a message..."

157
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,649
Oh, that's right. You ignore me, too.

158
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,929
The dark patches are burn marks.
In all probability, a bomb.

159
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,969
But they were passing through
an electrical storm,

160
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,529
and until we can rule out
a lightning strike...

161
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,529
...my advice would be
to say nothing.

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,889
Jesus.

163
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,889
Poor bastards.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,600
Spike Ellis Kane.

165
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,169
Why?

166
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,529
Too close to the PM.

167
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,529
Anthony Fossett's close to the PM.

168
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,529
How come we don't delete him?

169
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,249
Sir...

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,249
Problem, Sergeant?

171
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,569
Oh, Jesus Christ.
It's Lord Snooty.

172
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,920
Hello, Tony.

173
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,329
Hello, Tony.
You didn't answer my calls!

174
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,329
Have you seen my schedule for today?

175
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,569
Have you seen my schedule for today?
So you're busy. Don't carp.

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,569
Some of us aren't. What...
What do you think of your boss, guys?

177
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,769
I say he's a fucking cock who
doesn't remember who his friends are.

178
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,769
Don't...

179
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,769
You don't say much, do you?

180
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,969
Can we talk freely?

181
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,969
Can we talk freely?
I think you already have.

182
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,369
Dermot Matthews was dying

183
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,889
before he was killed
in the Scarrow explosion.

184
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,449
Dermot...?

185
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,489
You found his daughter's hand.

186
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,089
His immune system was totally fucked.

187
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,569
The problem is,

188
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,009
the trigger word is Nightlight.

189
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,249
Whenever he says Nightlight,
I'm supposed to monitor.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,279
So?

191
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,049
So?
But his cat's called Nightlight.

192
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,049
Nightlight was an MI5/Special Branch
operation in Northern Ireland
in the '80s.

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,769
We are a listening station, Agnes.

194
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,769
That's all.

195
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,849
Matthews worked at PetroFex,

196
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,849
which his GP thinks was significant,
as does the pathologist.

197
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,489
There's mention of a substance. Um...

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,089
It's...

199
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,089
..PFX-44.

200
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,209
They won't spike Tony Fossett
because he's an intramural subject.

201
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,129
Meaning?

202
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,129
Special request
by someone senior in Intelligence.

203
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,409
Laura, what an...
what an unexpected pleasure.

204
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,649
The sergeant will take you home now,
Tony.

205
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,000
The night is young.

206
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,769
The Prime Minister's car
is waiting for him.

207
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,849
Then perhaps you and I could go
and find somewhere quiet

208
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,200
and talk about old times.

209
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,609
and talk about old times.
You're not cleared to be here, Tony.

210
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,849
And you're drunk.

211
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,849
I am not drunk. Huh?
I'm not falling down, am I?

212
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,889
I'm not... I'm not...stotious,
as they say in the Six Counties.

213
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,209
Do you remember them?

214
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,889
Oh, this is great, isn't it?

215
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,889
Three Westminster panjandrums
enjoying each other's company

216
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,449
at the fulcrum of imperial power.

217
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,129
Cigar, anyone?

218
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,529
Ah-ha-ha...!

219
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,849
Come on, sir. Time to go.

220
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,809
Another time.

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,049
I'll hold you to that.

222
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,049
Hey...!

223
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
It's personal.

224
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,229
I embarrassed you, Tom. Sorry.

225
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,189
No, Tony, it's OK.

226
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,189
We were both going places once,
weren't we?

227
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,509
You got over your...bump in the road.

228
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,189
Nightlight! Here, puss.

229
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,189
I never got over mine.

230
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,629
You will, Tony.

231
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,709
You will.

232
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,709
Come here.

233
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,149
How about a quick one
down the Drum and Monkey

234
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,349
before it's feeding time for you
penguins?

235
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,709
I can't. Really, I can't.

236
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,060
I can't. Really, I can't.
Yeah, you can.

237
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,869
You're the Prime Minister.

238
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,269
Gotta go, Tony.

239
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,269
What, gonna let Nanny tell you
who you can and can't play with?

240
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,949
A bad influence, am I? Is that it?

241
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,149
Know too much about you, do I?

242
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,029
Good night, Tony.

243
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,029
Not allowed on little Tommy's
trampoline?

244
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,620
Morning, Laura.

245
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,869
Does Sergeant Wrigglesworth
not encourage you to jog

246
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,469
somewhere different every time?

247
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,789
Yes, he does.Hmm.

248
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,789
So...do you have anything
on the black box for me?

249
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,629
Or should I...should I ask
Tony Fossett?

250
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,709
The tabloids' favourite
phone hacker?

251
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,989
Well, the man had to eat.

252
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,989
And you were the one who put him
out of a job at MI5.

253
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,109
He said that you sacked him
to cover up your own mistakes.

254
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,669
Did he?

255
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,189
And does he think it's funny
bandying that stuff about

256
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,709
when he's aware there's people
who'll twist it against me?

257
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,709
You saw him. He's unstable.

258
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,149
No. Nothing on the black box.

259
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,069
Al-Qaeda claimed it pretty early on,
but then again, they would.

260
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,069
Their Arabian Peninsula man,

261
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,789
al-Gamdi, has form
with aircraft bombs,

262
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,589
and we know he's in Afghanistan.

263
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,589
Which is a long way
out of his comfort zone.

264
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,589
So something's up.

265
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,789
We all have a past, Tom.

266
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,749
Why do you think he was
on the plane?

267
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,909
Everybody else in the picture
got on the plane. Count them.

268
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,269
So what's he doing there?

269
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,269
Walking past, that's what it looks
like to me. Who knows?

270
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,389
And this one?

271
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,429
That's one of the pilots.

272
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,780
Look at his shirt.

273
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,749
Both the pilots are there.

274
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,629
How long have you spent on this?

275
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,629
I've only been doing it
in my spare time.

276
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,989
The Prime Minister died on that
flight.

277
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,269
Shouldn't we be exploring
every possible angle?

278
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,629
You're beyond your remit.

279
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,429
I'm bored of my remit.

280
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,429
That's why you showed me those.

281
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,989
Then I'll take it from here.

282
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,229
I want my contribution credited.

283
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,629
If you want stars on your badge,
go and work for McDonald's.

284
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,669
The pathologist's request
for information.

285
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,229
Now, I'm not going to tell you your
job, Prime Minister, but I can't see

286
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,580
why you want to set me up

287
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,549
as the head of a very expensive
public inquiry team

288
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,549
if you're going to dish out surmise
and half-truth to the Fourth Estate

289
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,029
before I've got my feet
under the desk.

290
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,349
Well, I'm not going to tell you
your job, Lord Holbeck,

291
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,989
but the country's demanding answers.

292
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,829
HSE is dragging its feet.

293
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,349
The company is dragging its feet.

294
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,029
Paul Clark is incommunicado.

295
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,789
And the compensation
is nowhere in sight.

296
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,349
Now...

297
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,469
PFX-44.

298
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,749
Do they say what that is?

299
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,389
No. The PetroFex take on it

300
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,389
seems to be that the toxins
are an unnecessary distraction.

301
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,509
They maintain that it's dirty tricks
by green activists, or sabotage.

302
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,549
And have you seen anything
that might back that up?

303
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,149
About the only thing
we have managed to ascertain

304
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,589
is that the shockwave travelled
a great deal further

305
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,349
than the existing worst-case
scenarios.

306
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,349
The initial explosion seems
to have been aggravated by a second.

307
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,629
When I hear more, I'll let you know.

308
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,629
Thank you.

309
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,029
General Munnery wants a word
before Prime Minister's Questions.

310
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,029
He says it's urgent.

311
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,429
Peter, would you put the sound up,
please?

312
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,349
Responding to a question about
the lack of progress

313
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,029
with the PetroFex compensation deal
for Scarrow,

314
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,629
Mrs Yelland is said to have remarked
that there are some politicians

315
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,909
who take very naturally
to leadership,

316
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,669
and others who need time
to find their range.

317
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,669
No need to read tweets now,
is there?

318
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,549
I'm going to put a clock
on PetroFex.

319
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,269
They have until midday tomorrow.
Tell them I expect them

320
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,109
to provide the coroner
with everything

321
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,789
the former pathologist requested.

322
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,949
And tell them I'll be addressing
the nation on the issue.

323
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,389
Have you spoken to Paul Clark?

324
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,740
Not yet, no.

325
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,989
Call him. Tell him as well.

326
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,349
It's the middle of the night
where he is.

327
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,349
Wake the bastard.

328
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,549
Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda's number three,
al-Gamdi, is on the move.

329
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,669
Footage from an unarmed drone,
one of ours, taken yesterday.

330
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,029
Was he aware he was spotted?

331
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,389
No evidence for that,
Foreign Secretary.

332
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,740
And where is he now?

333
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,789
Holed up near Lashkar Gah.

334
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,429
We're pretty sure he's making
for Yemen, via Oman,

335
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,189
so he may be planning
to pass through Pakistan here.

336
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,189
If we're going to get a shot at him,
it'll have to be before that.

337
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,069
Mm. And what do the Americans say?

338
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,909
Well, given their grandstanding

339
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,069
over the search
for the black box, I...

340
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,149
You haven't told them.

341
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,789
Not so as they'd notice.

342
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,229
And do you think they'd notice
if one of our submarines

343
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,229
took a bit of a poke around
for the black box?

344
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,789
Military men like ourselves,
Prime Minister,

345
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,949
we'd make a better fist
of running this country

346
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,949
than all the politicians
put together.

347
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,229
I think it's the fist part
that worries people, General.

348
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,940
Keep me informed.

349
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,869
Ros, walk with me.

350
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,149
It was supposed to be off
the record.

351
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,149
You know, Ros,
when I took over the leadership,

352
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,149
my first thought was to return you
very swiftly to the back benches.

353
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,989
Do you know who advised me
not to do that?

354
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,509
No, but you're going to tell me.

355
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,509
Nobody.

356
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,029
I'd like to know
the Prime Minister's thoughts

357
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,949
on his Foreign Secretary's comments.

358
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,949
Is she right in saying
that he's "yet to find his range"?

359
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,229
Or were her words perhaps taken
out of context?

360
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,149
I think the Right Honourable Member
has just answered her own question.

361
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,549
Does the Prime Minister at least
agree that PetroFex

362
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,429
is playing him for a fool...

363
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,069
...by refusing to provide
the coroner with information,

364
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,069
despite the Prime Minister's
much-publicised ultimatum?

365
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,069
Is the Prime Minister aware
of any response at all?

366
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,029
Perhaps the Right Honourable Member
will care to ask me in...

367
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,349
22 hours.

368
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,509
You want to be careful.

369
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,749
I don't actually, Felix.

370
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,389
I want to be noticed.

371
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,869
And when he comes a cropper,
I want people to say,

372
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,789
"Remember what Ros Yelland said?"

373
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,349
Have you seen his approval figures?

374
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,549
There'll be a wobble, one day.
Wait and see.

375
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,389
And maybe we'll have a proper
leadership election

376
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,829
instead of a coronation.

377
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,269
And then...who knows?

378
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,029
People like him.

379
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,029
The people like him.

380
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,349
Did he consult you about whether
to keep me in the Cabinet, Felix?

381
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,109
Well, he might have
talked about it briefly.

382
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,629
And you said what?

383
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,629
I said, "Absolutely.
Of course you should."

384
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,109
A potential leader like yourself...

385
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,389
General Munnery.

386
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,389
Says it's time to make a fist.

387
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,949
I think you know everyone -
Special Ops, MI5, MI6.

388
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,269
So this is our...our man, al-Gamdi.

389
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,749
Just need to get our angles right.

390
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,549
And get the word from you,
Prime Minister.

391
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,029
You're sure it's him?

392
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,829
We're as sure as we ever could be.

393
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,629
Er, we've not met, Prime Minister.
Not face to face.

394
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,229
William Hawley, MI6.

395
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,669
I'm not sure that we have,
in this light.

396
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,149
I do my best work in the dark.

397
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,909
Laura here prefers
a little more light.

398
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,749
You're wasting time.
If he crosses into Iran...

399
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,749
You may remember
his signature piece was that...

400
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,229
You may remember
his signature piece was that...
I don't need to be softened up.

401
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,069
I'm quite well aware that he's
a cold-hearted killer, thank you.

402
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,789
Of course. Forgetting you were
an Army man yourself.

403
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,069
Things have changed a bit
since then.

404
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,989
You get to stand a lot farther back
from the action, you mean.

405
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,989
It doesn't leave you, does it,
Prime Minister? Being in the field.

406
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,829
No, it doesn't.

407
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,549
Double back.

408
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,549
They're on to us.

409
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,509
We need to strike now. If they
split up and make a run for it,

410
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,509
we'll never get him.

411
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,469
Prime Minister...

412
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,469
Prime Minister,
we need to strike now.

413
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,229
Prime Minister,
this may be our one shot.

414
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,269
Passenger side. That'll be al-Gamdi.

415
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,669
Tom, for Christ's sake!

416
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,109
They've seen us.
They're taking cover.

417
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,509
Prime Minister...

418
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,509
Tom.

419
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,589
They're praying.

420
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,940
Well, then, we've got him.

421
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,669
We can't kill a man
while he's praying.

422
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,020
It's the best time to go,

423
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,829
when your stock's high
with your maker.

424
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,109
There's only one thing
watching over those guys from above,

425
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,749
and you won't find it in the Qur'an.

426
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,429
If we're going to act like gods,

427
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,429
can we at least maintain
the demeanour?

428
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,949
They're heading back to the vehicle.

429
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,269
Tom!

430
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,389
Prime Minister,
we're running out of time.

431
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,029
They're on the move.

432
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,029
This is our last chance.

433
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,540
Go.

434
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,820
Affirmative.

435
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:43,940
Got him!

436
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,709
Pick that out!

437
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,229
Congratulations, Prime Minister.
You killed a very bad man today.

438
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:10,349
I think a drink is called for.

439
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,789
I've just heard from
the crash investigation team.

440
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,149
They have ruled out
the lightning strike.

441
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,109
Was it a bomb?

442
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,709
Do you have any suspects?

443
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,709
You've just atomised
the most likely one.

444
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,069
Are the Americans going
to announce it?

445
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,469
No.

446
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,669
Then we have to.

447
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,109
It's going to leak out.

448
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,109
They want to do more analysis.

449
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,109
I don't want them doing anything
unless they inform us first.

450
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,389
Laura...

451
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,589
Those people
who might twist things against you.

452
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,589
Was one of them...?

453
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,269
Blooded now, Prime Minister?

454
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,269
One of us?

455
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,309
Hello?Piers?

456
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,909
Don't say my name.

457
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,309
Do you know who this is?

458
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,669
'Can you say some more?'

459
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,509
You gave me a reference for a job.

460
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,860
'Oh, yes.'

461
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,269
I was hoping we could...

462
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,029
..have a talk.

463
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,509
My advice
is to drop the PetroFex deadline.

464
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,749
You've got great headlines
on the al-Gamdi strike,

465
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,389
but you could lose all the benefit
of that if they defy you.

466
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,989
Bask in the glory while you can.
Unequivocal good news.

467
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,749
Not according to the US State
Department.

468
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,749
They're pissed off
they didn't get him, that's all.

469
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,029
Please.

470
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,789
Gina, if they meet my deadline,
I win.

471
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,140
If they don't,

472
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,069
they give me licence
to go after them twice as hard.

473
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,709
Thank you.

474
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,589
Of course, this doesn't mark
the end to the fight against terror.

475
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,509
There are still sinister forces
at work in our country

476
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,789
determined to disrupt
the process of democracy.

477
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,029
And I understand that there may be
some of you who have questions

478
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,549
about the action taken.

479
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,109
But be assured of this.

480
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,109
That because of British Intelligence
and British technology,

481
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,389
a terrorist responsible for
the deaths of thousands of people

482
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,709
has been stopped.

483
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,469
I think he just added "Churchillian"

484
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,309
to his positive points of reference.

485
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,549
Watch the clock.

486
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,349
And finally this is Madeline
Wolstencroft and Keith Thompson

487
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,700
from the Evening Globe.

488
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,349
Thank you so much for coming.

489
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,109
The deadline is in a few minutes.

490
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,949
Yes, I know, Gina. Thank you.

491
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,949
If you need
any further information...

492
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,989
Feel good to have your Army hat
back on again?

493
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,989
Everything clear-cut.

494
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,949
Good guys, bad guys.

495
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,069
You think I'm that uncomplicated?

496
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,429
No.

497
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,349
No. Your Press Officer,
on the other hand,

498
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,749
looks like she's growing
an ulcer very fast.

499
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,149
She's concerned about the deadline.

500
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,500
And you're not?

501
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,909
I was talking to a friend
the other day

502
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,229
and I was telling him
that I couldn't do something,

503
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,149
and he said, "Oh, yes, you can.

504
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,029
"You are the Prime Minister."
Maybe he's right.

505
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,149
Yeah.
While we're in Cloud Cuckoo Land,

506
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,189
when are we going to do this profile?

507
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,189
I'm afraid I have to hurry you
along, Ellis.

508
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,549
What is that?

509
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,549
Oh, that's just scraps
of my Tom Dawkins jigsaw.

510
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,229
I dig deep, by the way.

511
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,229
It's a rules of engagement card,
for Bosnia.

512
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,989
Yeah. I like to know the rules
of engagement.

513
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,989
Oh, a minute to, by the way.

514
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,700
Any news?

515
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,429
No.

516
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,229
So, go on.
You told your line manager.

517
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,509
He's always trying to find ways
of talking to me.

518
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,749
I think he thinks that this is
just another way he can...

519
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,589
And I don't want to go
above his head,

520
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,309
because we have to work together.

521
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,789
But I've seen something
in these photos.

522
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,789
I mean, it's all probably nothing...

523
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,789
Go on.

524
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,429
You recruited me, Piers.

525
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,429
And I thought if I told you, you
would... tell me what you thought.

526
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,709
Just a moment.

527
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,420
Agnes,

528
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,229
this is William Hawley, MI6.

529
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,669
Agnes is feeling a bit unloved,
William.

530
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,669
Ah, yes. Chilly place, Cheltenham,
Agnes. I've always said it.

531
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,389
William's very interested
in your findings.

532
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,509
Oh, rest assured, Miss Evans,

533
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,549
they're finding traction
in very high places,

534
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,549
and your name with them. All right?

535
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,949
You've already seen them?

536
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,949
We'll let the matter rest there
for now, shall we?

537
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,309
Let us take it from here.

538
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,749
Tony Fossett.

539
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,100
What about him?

540
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,989
I think MI5 might... Laura Duchenne

541
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,589
seems to have it in for him,
and I don't think it's right.

542
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,709
He's very close to the PM,

543
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,709
and perhaps
we shouldn't be monitoring him.

544
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,469
Don't worry, Agnes.

545
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,469
We know all about Tony Fossett.

546
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,349
Confusion in Whitehall

547
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,589
as the Prime Minister's deadline
comes and goes

548
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,549
with no response from PetroFex
bosses.

549
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,269
Oil tanker drivers
say they will take action

550
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,269
if fuel prices continue to rise.

551
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,029
Also this lunchtime,
youth unemployment

552
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,029
reaches a record high,
and an al-Qaeda...

553
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,029
What the fuck are they playing at?

554
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,389
Politics, I guess.

555
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,389
Want me to prepare a statement?

556
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,589
Yes, please.

557
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,069
Paul Clark, sir.
A friend of mine works at airports.

558
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,509
Apparently,
Clark's en route to Davos.

559
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,629
Anywhere but here!

560
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:04,749
Not quite, sir. He's stopping
to refuel at Biggin Hill.

561
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,149
We've held him as you requested,

562
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,989
but he's refusing to leave the
plane.

563
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,909
What if I go to him?

564
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,029
That would make me nervous,
Prime Minister.

565
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,949
Sergeant?

566
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,949
I could do with
stretching my legs, sir.

567
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,229
You don't suppose they'll shoot us,
do you, Sergeant?

568
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,229
You can never tell with
the Americans, sir.

569
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,149
Prime Minister, I'm going to ask you
to stop right there.

570
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,829
Is the man with you armed?

571
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,629
I should bloody well hope so.

572
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,629
I suggest you step down.

573
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,989
Thank you.

574
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,669
Tom!

575
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,109
What can I do for you?

576
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,709
Apart from sue you, of course.

577
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,309
My lawyers are on it as we speak.
They'll find something.

578
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,309
They're in touch with the US
Attorney General as well, by the way.

579
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,229
I want to know what PFX-44 is.

580
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,069
And I want to know
what happened to Dermot Matthews.

581
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,509
I signed a legal contract
with the British Government

582
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,189
to develop that site.

583
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,949
I provided 1,600 jobs that would
otherwise have gone to Poland.

584
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,629
I gave Dermot Matthews the first job
he or anyone in his family

585
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,509
had even heard of for a generation.

586
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,949
And what do I get for it?

587
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,789
Your company made billions
from that site.

588
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,789
And may I remind you that there are
19 people dead and 94 injured.

589
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,229
The people of Scarrow want to know

590
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,709
that you are going to pay up
and stay put.

591
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,069
You want us to make good
with the people of Scarrow,

592
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,749
cut out the red tape

593
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,709
and the deadlines...

594
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,189
..and the public inquiries.

595
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,189
You set up in this country,
you abide by its rules.

596
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,549
The oil majors
could buy and sell this country.

597
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,669
And you with it.

598
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,189
Be grateful we pay lip service.

599
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,189
What's PFX-44?

600
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,669
It's a new lightweight drone fuel
we're developing at Scarrow.

601
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,669
It's more jobs for your precious
country, more firepower.

602
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,989
Or, if you prefer, we can take
the whole thing to Poland.

603
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,789
Now, shall we drop it?

604
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,789
Charles Flyte did.

605
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,709
Who else knew?

606
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,389
Well, I'd love to tell you,

607
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,389
but unfortunately
your Chief of Defence Staff

608
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,389
made me sign a bit of paper
saying I wouldn't.

609
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,149
There's no evidence
that the drone fuel

610
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,669
caused or exacerbated
the disaster.

611
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,869
Do you actually believe that,
General?

612
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,869
Or are you just able to get your
mouth to form the words regardless?

613
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,669
A little respect, please,
Prime Minister.

614
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,829
I could remind you that you never
rose above the rank of captain.

615
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,669
And which electorate voted you
Chief of Defence Staff?

616
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,669
It was felt that any adverse
publicity to do with the drone fleet

617
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,189
might jeopardise the kill.

618
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,189
Which kill was that? Al-Gamdi
or the 19 people dead in Scarrow?

619
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,309
I want a list of everyone who knew.

620
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,509
Think of the long term.

621
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,029
Think of the lives saved
just 24 hours ago

622
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,029
with the drone strike you ordered.

623
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,909
Using the new drone fuel.

624
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,029
Was that an attempt to embroil me
in this conspiracy?

625
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,549
It's not as if it's your first,
Prime Minister.

626
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,469
I hope to God that you've held on
to your body armour, General.

627
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,949
Cos you're going to need it.

628
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,149
You're forgetting
the Official Secrets Act.

629
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,149
And you're presuming
your secret's official.

630
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,709
Nills.

631
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,709
Paul.

632
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,509
Dermot Matthews.

633
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,229
At the refinery gate.

634
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,789
So?

635
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,749
It's moments before the explosion.

636
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,749
And he wasn't on shift.

637
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,909
'As my deadline with the
company expired at noon today,

638
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,789
'I learned that a group of people
within the PetroFex Corporation

639
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,709
'have been working in secret

640
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,789
'to develop a fuel
for use in unmanned drones,

641
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,789
'like the ones responsible
for killing Tamin al-Gamdi.'

642
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,669
None of us will shed a tear
for a mass murderer like al-Gamdi,

643
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,060
but it's my belief

644
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,749
that the experimental fuel
may well be responsible

645
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,389
for the scale and ferocity
of the Scarrow explosion

646
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,389
and for the toxicity anomalies
I mentioned

647
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,869
in my press conference
a few days ago.

648
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,429
When one of the largest oil
companies in the world flouts

649
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,469
our nation's safety regulations

650
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,709
and the terms of the company's
agreement with the UK government,

651
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,709
I believe that we have to act,
and act together as a nation.

652
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,429
You know,

653
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,509
I was told today

654
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,509
that the oil majors
could buy and sell this country.

655
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,749
Petrodollars are a powerful
currency, there's no doubt.

656
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,389
But we hold a stronger one
in our democracy.

657
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,389
We call it the vote.

658
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,149
Tom...I'm sorry to disturb you.

659
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,829
That drone strike.

660
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,949
The Iranians say
it was on their side of the border.

661
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,189
They're treating it as an act of war.

662
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,589
We have not committed any act of war
against Iran.

663
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,589
There's...a small possibility that
the missile crossed the border.

664
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,069
PetroFex is said to be on the verge
of relocating to Poland.

665
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,149
They've suspended their offer
of compensation.

666
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,389
I'm gonna freeze
their fucking assets.

667
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,869
It's a good story,
but I can get you a better one.

668
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,349
Tom Dawkins: The Army Years.

669
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,109
This is your chance, Tom.

670
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,549
There is no story.

671
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,509
Sir, the biometric database
has been compromised.

672
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,899
Who is it?

673
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,109
Who is it?
His name's Sami Shiroor.

674
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,109
He was on the plane
with Charles Flyte.

675
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,109
He may have been working
for the Iranians.

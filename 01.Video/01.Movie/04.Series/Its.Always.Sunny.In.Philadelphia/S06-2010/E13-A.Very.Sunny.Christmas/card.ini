[storyline]
orig = After years of being mistreated by Frank during the holiday season when he buys gifts for himself, Dennis and Dee decide to teach him a lesson by contacting his old business partner, Eugene, for help to make the mean-spirited and nihilist Frank see the Christmas spirit of giving, rather than taking. Meanwhile, Mac and Charlie reflect on their childhood Christmases, and realize that they were not as joyous and wonderful as they remembered from Mac remembering being taught how to break into peoples houses to steal their Christmas presents by his career-criminal parents, and Charlie who remembers his single, boozed-out, coked-up mother inviting a slew of "Santas"/clients over at her house.

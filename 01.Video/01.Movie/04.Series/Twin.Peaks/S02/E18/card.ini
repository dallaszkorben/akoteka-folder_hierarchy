[storyline]
orig = 
en = Truman survives the attempt on his life by Ms. Jones, and returns to his job. Gordon Cole returns to Twin Peaks to reinstate Cooper into the FBI and to bring the classified file on Windom Earle, who is now eavesdropping on the police station with a hidden microphone in a bonsai plant. When Cole flirts with Shelly at the Double R Diner, her seductive appearance somehow makes him hear her voice. Enlightened that he can hear (at least her voice) Cole asks Shelly out on a date. Shelly is somewhat embarrassed, but flattered at the attention and accepts. Audrey continues pursuing Wheeler, but is thwarted by her father who sends her to Seattle on business. Donna enlists Audrey's help in investigating Donna's mother who may have a past connection with Ben Horne. Windom Earle continues stalking Cooper as well as making contact (in disguise) with Audrey, Shelly, and Donna. When Annie sees the symbols that Cooper drew from descriptions from Major Briggs and the Log Lady, and tells them they look similar to markings in Owl Cave, Cooper, Truman and deputies Andy and Hawk make a midnight trip to the cave where they discover mysterious petroglyph markings. Also, Donna receives a postcard from the departed James Hurley, as well as a invitation to join the annual Miss Twin Peaks Beauty Pagent.

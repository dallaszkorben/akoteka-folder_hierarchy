[storyline]
storyline_en = Jack Ryan is back and this time the bad guys are in his own government. When Admiral James Greer becomes sick with cancer, Ryan is appointed acting CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence. Almost before he can draw a breath in his new position, one of the president's closest friends and his family are murdered in their sleep by what appears to by drug cartels. Ryan is called in to investigate, but unknown to him the CIA has already sent a secret field operative to lead an illegal paramilitary force in Colombia against cartels. Things get even more complicated when his team is set up and he loses an agent in the field and a friend of his wife's, who was the murdered agent's secretary, is murdered that same day. Ryan must then risk not only his career, but his life to expose the truth behind the mystery.
storyline_hu = Az amerikai elnök közeli barátját, egy befolyásos üzletembert meggyilkolják. Kiderül, hogy a férfi pénzmosási akciókat végzett a kolumbiai drogkartell részére. Az ügy kivizsgálásával Jack Ryan CIA-ügynököt bízzák meg. Jack nem is sejti, hogy megbízói egy gerillacsapatot is Kolumbiába küldtek. Mikor Bogotában hajszál híján túlél egy támadást, világossá válik számára, hogy a Fehér Házban valakik kettős játékot űznek.

[storyline]
orig = 
en = Rock star Pink Floyd is a tortured soul. Because of his childhood, he has always tried to make meaningful emotional connections to other living creatures. That childhood includes not having a male role model with his father having been killed in the war, his overprotective mother smothering him, and an oppressive school system quashing his natural creativity. Being a rock star, he is often wanted more because of what he is than who he is. The most recent failure in that true connection to someone or something else is his marriage, when on tour, he discovers that his wife back home is cheating on him. His response is to go in the opposite direction, by building a figurative wall around him to isolate himself from the rest of the world, but not before showing graphically his feelings on different gut levels. The question becomes if he or anyone else can do anything to tear down the wall in a meaningful way.
hu = Egy rockzenész, Pink mély válságba került. Los Angeles-i szállodai szobájában gondolja végig a sikerhez vezető karrierjét, melynek következtében magánélete zátonyra futott. Rémképekben és -álmokban megjelenő rossz emlékei mind-mind egy-egy mozaikkő, amelyek egymásra rakódva mind magasabb falat emelnek körülötte, s ő egyre magányosabb, és közlésre, emberi érintkezésre mind képtelenebb.

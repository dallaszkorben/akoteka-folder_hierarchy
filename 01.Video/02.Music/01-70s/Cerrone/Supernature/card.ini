orig = Once upon a time science opened up the door\nWe would feed the hungry fields till they couldn't eat no more\nBut the potions that we made touched the creatures down below, oh\nAnd they grew up in the way that we'd never seen before\nSupernature, supernature\nSupernature, supernature\nSupernature, supernature\nSupernature, supernature\nThey were angry with the man 'cause he changed their way of life\nAnd they take their sweet revenge, as they trample through the night\nFor a hundred miles or more you can hear the people cry\nBut there's nothin' you can do even God is on their side\nSupernature, supernature\nSupernature, supernature\nSupernature, supernature\nSupernature, supernature\nHow can I explain, things are different today\nDarkness all around and nobody makes a sound\nSuch a sad affair, no one seems to care\nSupernature, better watch out\nLook at you now, better watch out\nLook at you now, supernature\nBetter watch out, there's no way to stop it now\nYou can't escape, it's too late\nLook what you've done, there's no place that you can run\nThe monster's made, we must pay\nSupernature, you better watch out\nSupernature, look at you now\nSupernature, you better watch out\nSupernature, look at you now\nBetter watch out, there's no way to stop it now\nYou can't escape, it's too late\n(Supernature)\nLook what you've done, there's no place that you can run\nThe monster's made, we must pay\nMaybe nature has a plan to control the ways of man\nHe must start from scratch again many battles he must win\nTill he earns his place on earth like the other creatures do\nWill there be a happy end, now that all depends on you\nSupernature, supernature\nSupernature, supernature\nSupernature

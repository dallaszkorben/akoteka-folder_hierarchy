en = Once I had a love and it was a gas\nSoon turned out had a heart of glass\nSeemed like the real thing, only to find\nMucho mistrust, love's gone behind\n\nOnce I had a love and it was divine\nSoon found out I was losing my mind\nIt seemed like the real thing but I was so blind\nMucho mistrust, love's gone behind\n\nIn between\nWhat I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine\nLove is so confusing there's no peace of mind\nIf I fear I'm losing you it's just no good\nYou teasing like you do\n\nOnce I had a love and it was a gas\nSoon turned out had a heart of glass\nSeemed like the real thing, only to find\nMucho mistrust, love's gone behind\n\nLost inside\nAdorable illusion and I cannot hide\nI'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside\nWe could've made it cruising, yeah\n\nYeah, riding high on love's true bluish light\n\nOnce I had a love and it was a gas\nSoon turned out to be a pain in the ass\nSeemed like the real thing only to find\nMucho mistrust, love's gone behind\n\nIn between\nWhat I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine\nLove is so confusing there's no peace of mind\nIf I fear I'm losing you it's just no good\nYou teasing like you do

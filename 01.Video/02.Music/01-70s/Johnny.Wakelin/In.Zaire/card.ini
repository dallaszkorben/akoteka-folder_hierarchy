[lyrics]
orig = Once there was a battle there in Zaire\nin Zaire\nHundred thousand people there in Zaire\nin Zaire\nAll those people gathered there in Zaire\nin Zaire\nTo see the rumble in the jungle there in Zaire\nin Zaire\n\nCame a man called Elijan in Zaire\nin Zaire\nWith him came the superstar in Zaire\nin Zaire\nAll those people came from far in Zaire\nin Zaire\nTo see the rumble in the jungle there in Zaire\nin Zaire\n\nAll those people chanted there in Zaire\nin Zaire\nSeven rounds of torture there in Zaire\nin Zaire\nOne more round and Ali's there in Zaire\nin Zaire\nThere was great excitement everywhere in Zaire\nin Zaire\n\nAnd who was the victor in the night? Elijah Mohammed's bog\nAli won the fight\nthe lightning struck twice in the night\nFirst in the ring and then after the fight in Zaire\nin Zaire

[lyrics]
orig = All the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown)\nAnd the sky is grey (and the sky is grey)\nI've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)\nOn a winter's day (on a winter's day)\nI'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)\nIf I was in L.A. (if I was in L.A.)\nCalifornia dreamin' (California dreamin')\nOn such a winter's day\nStopped into a church\nI passed along the way\nWell, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)\nAnd I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)\nYou know the preacher like the cold (preacher like the cold)\nHe knows I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay)\nCalifornia dreamin' (California dreamin')\nOn such a winter's day\nAll the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown)\nAnd the sky is grey (and the sky is grey)\nI've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)\nOn a winter's day (on a winter's day)\nIf I didn't tell her (if I didn't tell her)\nI could leave today (I could leave today)\nCalifornia dreamin' (California dreamin')\nOn such a winter's day (California dreamin')\nOn such a winter's day (California dreamin')\nOn such a winter's day

orig = It was me on that road\nBut you couldn't see me\nToo many lights out, but nowhere near here\nIt was me on that road\nStill you couldn't see me\nAnd then flashlights and explosions\nRoads are getting nearer\nWe cover distance but not together\nI am the storm and I am the wonder\nAnd the flashlights, nightmares\nAnd sudden explosions\nI don't know what more to ask for\nI was given just one wish\nIt's about you and the sun\nA morning run\nThe story of my maker\nWhat I have and what I ache for\nI've got a golden ear\nI cut and I spear\nAnd what else is there\nRoads are getting nearer\nWe cover distance still not together\nIf I am the storm if I am the wonder\nWill I have flashlights, nightmares\nAnd sudden explosions\nI don't know what more to ask for\nI was given just one wish\nRoads are getting nearer\nWe cover distance but not together\nI am the storm if I am the wonder\nAnd the flashlights, nightmares\nAnd sudden explosions\nThere's no room where I can go and\nYou've got secrets too\nI don't know what more to ask for\nI was given just one wish

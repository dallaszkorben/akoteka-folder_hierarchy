[lyrics]
orig = He left no time to regret\nKept his dick wet\nWith his same old safe bet\nMe and my head high\nAnd my tears dry\nGet on without my guy\nYou went back to what you knew\nSo far removed from all that we went through\nAnd I tread a troubled track\nMy odds are stacked\nI'll go back to black\nWe only said goodbye with words\nI died a hundred times\nYou go back to her\nAnd I go back to\nI go back to us\nI love you much\nIt's not enough\nYou love blow and I love puff\nAnd life is like a pipe\nAnd I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside\nWe only said goodbye with words\nI died a hundred times\nYou go back to her\nAnd I go back to\nWe only said goodbye with words\nI died a hundred times\nYou go back to her\nAnd I go back to\nBlack\nBlack\nBlack\nBlack\nBlack\nBlack\nBlack\nI go back to\nI go back to\nWe only said goodbye with words\nI died a hundred times\nYou go back to her\nAnd I go back to\nWe only said goodbye with words\nI died a hundred times\nYou go back to her\nAnd I go back to black

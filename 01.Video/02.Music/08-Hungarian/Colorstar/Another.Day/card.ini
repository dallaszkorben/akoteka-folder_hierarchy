[lyrics]
orig = 
en = When your pulse starts to beat,\nwhen you're born just like a scientific miracle.\n\nWhen you wake, start to feel,\nwhen you sleep, let's start to make a film about the day.\n\nWhen you take, when you play, when you sell,\nwhen you have to pay for everything.\n\nWhen you love, when you hate, when you hope,\nit's just a scientific fairy tale inside your head.\n\nA day, another day, another day. . .\nIt's just another. . .\n\nYou can hide in your dream,\nfantasize and make a film about tomorrow.\n\nDon't you think it's for real,\nWhat you see is just a scientific, spherical painting.\n\nWhen you come, when you go, when you stay\nor just lay down on your bed and wait for tomorrow.\n\nDon't you think it's for real,\nwhat you hear, is just the scientific, spherical voices.\n\nIt's just another scientific miracle under the Holy Sun.

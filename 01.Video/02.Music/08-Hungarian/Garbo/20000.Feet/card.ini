en = I saw him walking like a madman\nI saw the sign he’d come again\nMoving in a most peculiar way\nIt simply took my breath away\n\nOffice blocks crashing down\nAnd hi-speed trains thrown aside\nAnd he was 20,000 feet\nJust as if he knew no defeat\n\nSirens wail and drones are out\nSomething the press will talk about\nStanding high against the falling night\nAnd I was just drinking in his might

orig = Give me light\nGive me action\nAt the touch of a button\nFlying through hyper-space\nIn a computer interface\nStop living on video\nStop integrated circuits\nStop sur un faisceau de lumière\nStop is this reality?\nTraveling in a light beam\nLaser rays and purple skies\nIn a computer fairyland\nIt is a dream you bring to life\nStop living on video\nStop integrated circuits\nStop sur un faisceau de lumière\nStop is this reality?\nLiving on video\nSur un faisceau de lumière\nI see your glitterring blue eyes\nYou look at me with a smile\nIt's a computer fantasy\nIt is waiting for you and me\nLiving, living on video\nLiving, living on video\nLiving, living on video\nStop\nVideo, video, video\nVideo\nVideo\nVideo

en = If I wait for just a second more,\nI know I'll forget what I came here for,\nMy head was so full of things to say,\nBut as I open my lips all my words slip away\nAnd anyway,\nI can't believe you want to turn the page,\nAnd move your life onto another stage,\nYou can change the chapter you can change the book,\nBut the story remains the same if you'd take a look.\n\nFor the times we've had I don't want to be - a page in your diary babe,\nFor the good, the bad I don't want to see - a page in your diary babe,\nFor the happy, the sad - I don't want to be another page in your diary.\n\nPerhaps if I held you I could win again,\nI could take your hands we'd talk and maybe then -\nThat look in your eyes I always recognise,\nWould tell me everything is gonna be fine,\nYou're gonna be mine\nFor a long time...\n\nFor the times we've had I don't want to be - a page in your diary babe,\nFor the good, the bad I don't want to see - a page in your diary babe,\nFor the happy, the sad - I don't want to be another page in your diary.\n\nFor the times we've had I don't want to be - a page in your diary babe,\nFor the good, the bad I don't want to see - a page in your diary babe,\nFor the happy, the sad - I don't want to be another page in your history.

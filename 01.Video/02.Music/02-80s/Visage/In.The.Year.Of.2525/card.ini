[lyrics]
orig = In the year of 2525\nIf man is still alive\nIf woman can survive\nThey may find\nIn the year of 3535\nCan't tell the truth, can't tell no lie\nEverything you think, do and say\nIs in the pill you took today\nIn the year of 4545\nWon't need no teeth, won't need your eyes\nWon't find a thing to do\nNobody's gonna look at you\nIn the year of 5555\nYour arms are hanging limp at your side\nYour legs have nothing to do\nSome machines doin' that for you\nIn the year of 6565\nWon't need no husband, won't need no wife\nYou'll pick your sons, pick your daughters too\nFrom the bottom of a long glass tube woo\nIn the year of 7510\nIf God is comin' he should make it by then\nMaybe he'll look around and say:\n"Now it's time for the judgement day!"\nIn the year of 8510\nGod is gonna shake his mighty hand\nHe'll leave a salient place where man has been\nOr tear it down and start again wouwo\nIn the year of 9595\nI'm wondering if man is gonna be alive\nHe's taken everything earth had to give\nAnd he's put back nothing woo\nNow it's been ten thousand years man has cried a million tears\nFor what he never knew now man's dream is through\nBut through eternal light the twinklin' of starlight\nSo very far away now it's night to yesterday

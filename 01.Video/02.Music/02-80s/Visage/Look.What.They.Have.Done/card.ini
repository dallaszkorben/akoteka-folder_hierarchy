en = Hey, look there\nSo strange\nThrough the walls, I can hear them talk about\nSomeone who, sounds a lot like me\nWhispers so soft (It really doesn't matter)\nWhispers so clear (It really doesn't matter)\nWhat have they done to me?\nBehind their hands, I can see them smile at me\nTell about everything I do\nPulling me down (It really doesn't matter)\nUnderground\nWhat have they done to me?\nThe pain, it's so strange\nIt's not the same, It's so strange

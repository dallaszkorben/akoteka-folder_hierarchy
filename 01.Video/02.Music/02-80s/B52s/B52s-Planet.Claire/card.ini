[lyrics]
orig = She came from Planet Claire\nI knew she came from there\nShe drove a Plymouth Satellite\nA-faster than the speed of light\nPlanet Claire has pink air\nAll the trees are red\nNo one ever dies there\nNo one has a head\nSome say she's from Mars\nOr one of the seven stars that shine after three-thirty in the morning\nWell, she isn't!\nShe came from Planet Claire\nShe came from Planet Claire\nShe came from Planet Claire

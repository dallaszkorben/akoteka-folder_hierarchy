[lyrics]
orig = We were at a party\nHis earlobe fell in the deep\nSomeone reached in and grabbed it\nIt was a rock lobster\nRock lobster\nRock lobster\nWe were at the beach\nEverybody had matching towels\nSomebody went under a dock\nAnd there they saw a rock\nIt wasn't a rock\nIt was a rock lobster\nRock lobster\nRock lobster\nRock lobster\nRock lobster\nMotion in the ocean\nHis air hose broke\nLots of trouble\nLots of bubble\nHe was in a jam\nS'in a giant clam\nRock rock\nRock lobster\nDown, down\nLobster rock\nLobster rock\nLet's rock!\nBoy's in bikinis\nGirls in surfboards\nEverybody's rockin'\nEverybody's fruggin'\nTwistin' 'round the fire\nHavin' fun\nBakin' potatoes\nBakin' in the sun\nPut on your noseguard\nPut on the Lifeguard\nPass the tanning butter\nHere comes a stingray\nThere goes a manta-ray\nIn walked a jelly fish\nThere goes a dog-fish\nChased by a cat-fish\nIn flew a sea robin\nWatch out for that piranha\nThere goes a narwhal\nHere comes a bikini whale!\nRock lobster\nRock lobster\nRock lobster\nRock lobster

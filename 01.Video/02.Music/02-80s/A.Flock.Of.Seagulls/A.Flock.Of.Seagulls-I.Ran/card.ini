[lyrics]
orig = I walk along the avenue\nI never thought I'd meet a girl like you\nMeet a girl like you\nWith auburn hair and tawny eyes\nThe kind of eyes that hypnotize me through\nYou hypnotize me through\n\nAnd I ran, I ran so far away\nI just ran, I ran all night and day\nI couldn't get away\n\nA cloud appears above your head\nA beam of light comes shining down on you\nShining down on you\nThe cloud is moving nearer still\nAurora Borealis comes in view\nAurora comes in view\n\nAnd I ran, I ran so far away\nI just ran, I ran all night and day\nI couldn't get away\n\nReached out a hand to touch your face\nYou're slowly disappearing from my view\n'Appearing from my view\nReached out a hand to try again\nI'm floating in a beam of light with you\nA beam of light with you\n\nAnd I ran, I ran so far away\nI just ran, I ran all night and day\n\nAnd I ran, I ran so far away\nI just ran, I couldn't get away

en = Enola Gay\nYou should have stayed at home yesterday\nAh-ha words can't describe\nThe feeling and the way you lied\n\nThese games you play\nThey're going to end in more than tears some day\nAh-ha Enola Gay\nIt shouldn't ever have to end this way\n\nIt's eight fifteen\nAnd that's the time that it's always been\nWe got your message on the radio\nConditions normal and you're coming home\n\nEnola Gay\nIs mother proud of little boy today\nAh-ha this kiss you give\nIt's never ever going to fade away\n\nEnola Gay\nIt shouldn't ever have to end this way\nAh-ha Enola Gay\nIt shouldn't fade in our dreams away\n\nIt's eight fifteen\nAnd that's the time that it's always been\nWe got your message on the radio\nConditions normal and you're coming home\n\nEnola Gay\nIs mother proud of little boy today\nAh-ha this kiss you give\nIt's never ever going to fade away

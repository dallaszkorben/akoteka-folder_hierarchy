[lyrics]
orig = Baby Grace is the victim\nShe was 14 years of age\nAnd the wheels are turning, turning\nFor the finger points at me\nBut I have not been to Oxford Town\n(All's well)\nNo I have not been to Oxford Town\nToll the bell\nPay the private eye\n(All's well)\n20th century dies\nAnd the prison priests are decent\nMy attorney seems sincere\nI fear my days are numbered\nLord get me out of here\nBut I have not been to Oxford Town\n(All's well)\nBut I have not been to Oxford Town\nToll the bell\nPay the private eye\n(All's well)\n20th century dies\nThis is your shadow on my wall\nThis is my flesh and blood\nThis is what I could've been\nAnd the wheels are turning and turning\nAs the 20th century dies\nIf I had not ripped the fabric\nIf time had not stood still\nIf I had not met Ramona\nIf I'd only paid my bill\nBut I have not been to Oxford Town\n(All's well)\nBut I have not been to Oxford Town\nToll the bell\nPay the private eye\n(All's well)\n20th century dies\nThis is my bunk with two sheets\nThis is my food though foul\nThis is what I could have been\nToll the bell\nPay the private eye\n(All's well)\n20th century dies\nToll the bell\nPay the private eye\n(All's well)\n20th century dies\n(All's well)\n20th century dies\n(All's well)\nAll's well, all's well\nToll the bell\nPay the private eye\n(All's well)\n20th century dies\nToll the bell\nPay the private eye\n(All's well)\n20th century dies

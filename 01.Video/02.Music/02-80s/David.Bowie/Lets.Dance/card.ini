[lyrics]
orig = Let's dance\nPut on your red shoes and dance the blues\nLet's dance\nTo the song they're playin' on the radio\nLet's sway\nWhile color lights up your face\nLet's sway\nSway through the crowd to an empty space\nIf you say run\nI'll run with you\nAnd if you say hide\nWe'll hide\nBecause my love for you\nWould break my heart in two\nIf you should fall into my arms\nAnd tremble like a flower\nLet's dance\nLet's dance\nFor fear your grace should fall\nLet's dance\nFor fear tonight is all\nLet's sway\nYou could look into my eyes\nLet's sway\nUnder the moonlight, this serious moonlight\nAnd if you say run\nI'll run with you\nAnd if you say hide\nWe'll hide\nBecause my love for you\nWould break my heart in two\nIf you should fall into my arms\nAnd tremble like a flower\nLet's dance\nPut on your red shoes and dance the blues\nLet's sway\nUnder the moonlight, this serious moonlight\nLet's dance\nLet's dance\nLet's dance, dance, dance

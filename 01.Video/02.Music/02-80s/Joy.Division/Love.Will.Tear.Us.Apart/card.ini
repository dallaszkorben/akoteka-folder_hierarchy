orig = 
en = When routine bites hard,\nAnd ambitions are low,\nAnd resentment rides high,\nBut emotions won't grow,\nAnd we're changing our ways,\nTaking different roads.\n\nThen love, love will tear us apart again.\nLove, love will tear us apart again.\n\nWhy is the bedroom so cold?\nYou've turned away on your side.\nIs my timing that flawed?\n\nOur respect runs so dry.\nYet there's still this appeal\nThat we've kept through our lives.\n\nBut love, love will tear us apart again.\nLove, love will tear us apart again.\n\nYou cry out in your sleep,\nAll my failings exposed.\nAnd there's a taste in my mouth,\nAs desperation takes hold.\nJust that something so good\nJust can't function no more.\n\nBut love, love will tear us apart again.\nLove, love will tear us apart again.\nLove, love will tear us apart again.\nLove, love will tear us apart again.

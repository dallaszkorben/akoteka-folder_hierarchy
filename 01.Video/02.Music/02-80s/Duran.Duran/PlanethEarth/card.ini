en = Only came outside to watch the nightfall with the rain\nI heard you making patterns rhyme\nLike some new romantic looking for the TV sound\nYou'll see I'm right some other time\n\nLook now, look all around, there's no sign of life\nVoices, another sound, can you hear me now?\nThis is planet earth you're looking at planet earth\nBop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop this is planet earth\n\nMy head is stuck on something precious, let me know\nIf you're coming down to land\nIs there anybody out there trying to get through?\nMy eyes are so cloudy I can't see you\n\nLook now, look all around\nThere's no sign of life\nVoices, another sound\nCan you hear me now?\nThis is planet earth, you're looking at planet earth\nBop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop this is planet earth\n\nLook now, look all around\nThere's no sign of life\nVoices, another sound\nCan you hear me now?\nThis is planet earth, you're looking at planet earth\nBop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop this is planet earth\nBop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop calling planet earth\nBop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop looking at planet earth\nBop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop this is planet earth

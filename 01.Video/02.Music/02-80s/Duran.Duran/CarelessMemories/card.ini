[storyline]
storyline_en = So soon just after you've gone\nMy senses sharpen\nBut it always takes so damn long\nBefore I feel how much my eyes have darkened\n\nFear hangs in a plane of gun smoke\nDrifting in our room\nSo easy to disturb, with a thought, with a whisper\nWith a careless memory, with a careless memory\n\nOn the table, signs of love lies scattered\nAnd the walls break, with a crashing within\nIt's not as though, as though you really mattered\nBut being close, how could I let you go\nWithout some feeling, some precious sympathy following\n\nFear hangs in a plane of gun smoke\nDrifting in our room\nSo easy to disturb with a thought, with a whisper\nWith a careless memory, with a careless memory\nWith a careless memory, with a careless memory\n\nI walk out into the sun, I try to find a new day\nBut the whole place just screams in my eyes\nWhere are you now 'cause I don't want to meet you\nI think I'd die, I think I'd laugh at you\nI know I'd cry, what am I supposed to do, follow you\n\nOutside the thoughts coming flooding back now\nI just try to forget you\n\nSo easy to disturb with a thought with a whisper\nWith a careless memory, with a careless memory\nWith a careless memory, look out\nWith a careless memory\nWith a careless memory\nLook out\nLook out\nLook out\nLook out

orig = 
en = You saw me standing by the wall corner of a main street\nAnd the lights are flashing on your window sill\nAll alone ain't much fun so you're looking for the thrill\nAnd you know just what it takes and where to go\n\nDon't save a prayer for me now\nSave it til the morning after\nNo don't say a prayer for me now\nSave it til the morning after\n\nFeel the breeze deep on the inside look you down into the well\nIf you can you'll see the world in all his fire\nTake a chance like all dreamers can't find another way\nYou don't have to dream it all, just live a day\n\nDon't say a prayer for me now\nSave it 'til the morning after\nNo don't say a prayer for me now\nSave it 'til the morning after\nSave it 'til the morning after\nSave it 'til the morning after\n\nPretty looking road I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin\nDon't ask me why I'll keep my promise melt the ice\nAnd you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance\nBut fear is in your soul\nSome people call it a one night stand but we can call it paradise\n\nDon't say a prayer for me now\nSave it til the morning after\nNo don't say a prayer for me now\nSave it 'til the morning after\nSave it 'til the morning after\nSave it 'til the morning after\nSave it 'til the morning after\nSave it 'til the morning after (doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)\nSave a prayer 'til the morning after\nSave a prayer 'til the morning after\nSave a prayer 'til the morning after\nSave a prayer 'til the morning after\nSave a prayer 'til the morning after\nSave a prayer 'til the morning after

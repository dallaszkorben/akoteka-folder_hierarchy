[lyrics]
orig = There'll be times\nWhen my crimes\nWill seem almost unforgivable\nI give in to sin\nBecause you have to make this life livable\n\nBut when you think I've had enough\nFrom your sea of love\nI'll take more than another river full\nYes, and I'll make it all worthwhile\nI'll make your heart smile\n\nStrangelove\nStrange highs and strange lows\nStrangelove\nThat's how my love goes\nStrangelove\nWill you give it to me?\n\nWill you take the pain\nI will give to you?\nAgain and again\nAnd will you return it?\n\nThere'll be days\nWhen I'll stray\nI may appear to be\nConstantly out of reach\nI give in to sin\nBecause I like to practice what I preach\n\nI'm not trying to say\nI'll have it all my way\nI'm always willing to learn\nWhen you've got something to teach\nAnd I'll make it all worthwhile\nI'll make your heart smile\n\nPain, will you return it?\nI'll say it again, pain\nPain, will you return it?\nI'll say it again, pain\n\nPain, will you return it?\nI'll say it again, pain\nPain, will you return it?\nI won't say it again\n\nStrangelove\nStrange highs and strange lows\nStrangelove\nThat's how my love goes\nStrangelove\nWill you give it to me?\n\nStrangelove\nStrange highs and strange lows\nStrangelove\nThat's how my love goes\nStrangelove\nWill you give it to me?\n\nStrangelove\nStrange highs and strange lows\nStrangelove\nThat's how my love goes\nStrangelove\nWill you give it to me?\n\nI give in\nAgain and again\nI give in\nWill you give it to me?\nI give in\nI'll say it again\nI give in\nI give in\nAgain and again\nI give in\nThat's how my love goes\nI give in\nI'll say it again\nI give in\nI give in

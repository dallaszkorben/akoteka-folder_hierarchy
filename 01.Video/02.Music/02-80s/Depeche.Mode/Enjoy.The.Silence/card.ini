[lyrics]
orig = Words like violence\nBreak the silence\nCome crashing in\nInto my little world\nPainful to me\nPierce right through me\nCan't you understand?\nOh my little girl\nAll I ever wanted\nAll I ever needed\nIs here in my arms\nWords are very unnecessary\nThey can only do harm\nVows are spoken\nTo be broken\nFeelings are intense\nWords are trivial\nPleasures remain\nSo does the pain\nWords are meaningless\nAnd forgettable\nAll I ever wanted\nAll I ever needed\nIs here in my arms\nWords are very unnecessary\nThey can only do harm\n\nAll I ever wanted\nAll I ever needed\nIs here in my arms\nWords are very unnecessary\nThey can only do harm\nAll I ever wanted\nAll I ever needed\nIs here in my arms\nWords are very unnecessary\nThey can only do harm\n\nEnjoy the silence

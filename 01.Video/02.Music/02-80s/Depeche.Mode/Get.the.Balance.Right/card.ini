[lyrics]
orig = There's more besides joyrides\nLittle house in the countryside\nUnderstand, learn to demand,\nCompromise, sometimes lie\nGet the Balance right, get the balance right \nBe responsible, respectable,\nStable but gullible\nConcerned and caring, help the helpless\nBut always remain ultimately selfish\nGet the balance right, get the balance right\nYou think you've got a hold of it all\nYou haven't got a hold at all\nWhen you reach the top, get ready to drop\nPrepare yourself for the fall, you're gonna fall\nIt's almost predictable\nDon't take this way, don't take that way\nStraight down the middle until next Thursday\nPush to the left, back to the right\nTwist and turn 'til you've got it right\nGet the balance right

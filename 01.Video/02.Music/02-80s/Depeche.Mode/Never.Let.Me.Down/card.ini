[lyrics]
orig = I'm taking a ride\nWith my best friend\nI hope he never lets me down again\n\nHe knows where he's taking me\nTaking me where I want to be\nI'm taking a ride\nWith my best friend\n\nWe're flying high\nWe're watching the world pass us by\nNever want to come down\nNever want to put my feet back down\nOn the ground\n\nI'm taking a ride\nWith my best friend\nI hope he never lets me down again\n\nPromises me I'm as safe as houses\nAs long as I remember who's wearing the trousers\nI hope he never lets me down again\nWe're flying high\nWe're watching the world pass us by\nNever want to come down\nNever want to put my feet back down\nOn the ground\nWe're flying high\nWe're watching the world pass us by\nNever want to come down\nNever want to put my feet back down\nOn the ground\n\nNever let me down\nNever let me down\nNever let me down\nNever let me down\n\nSee the stars, they're shining bright\nEverything's alright tonight\nSee the stars, they're shining bright\nEverything's alright tonight\nSee the stars, they're shining bright\nEverything's alright tonight\nSee the stars, they're shining bright\nEverything's alright tonight

[lyrics]
orig = People are people so why should it be\nYou and I should get along so awfully\n\nSo we're different colours\nAnd we're different creeds\nAnd different people have different needs\nIt's obvious you hate me\nThough I've done nothing wrong\nI never even met you\nSo what could I have done\n\nI can't understand\nWhat makes a man\nHate another man\nHelp me understand\n\nPeople are people so why should it be\nYou and I should get along so awfully\n\nHelp me understand\n\nNow you're punching and you're kicking\nAnd you're shouting at me\nI'm relying on your common decency\nSo far it hasn't surfaced\nBut I'm sure it exists\nIt just takes a while to travel\nFrom your head to your fist\n\nI can't understand\nWhat makes a man\nHate another man\n\nHelp me understand

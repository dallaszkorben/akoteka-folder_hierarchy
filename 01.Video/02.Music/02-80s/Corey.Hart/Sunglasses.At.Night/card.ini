orig = I wear my sunglasses at night\nSo I can so I can\nWatch you weave then breathe your story lines\nAnd I wear my sunglasses at night\nSo I can so I can\nKeep track of the visions in my eyes\nWhile she's deceiving me\nIt cuts my security has\nShe got control of me\nI turn to her and say\nDon't switch the blade on the guy in shades oh no\nDon't masquerade with the guy in shades oh no\nI can't believe it!\n'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades oh no\nAnd I wear my sunglasses at night\nSo I can so I can\nForget my name while you collect your claim\nAnd I wear my sunglasses at night\nSo I can so I can\nSee the light that's right before my eyes\nWhile she's deceiving me\nShe cuts my security\nHas she got control of me\nI turn to her and say\nDon't switch the blade on the guy in shades oh no\nDon't masquerade with the guy in shades oh no\nI can't believe it!\n'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades oh no\n'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades oh no\nOh I say I wear my sunglasses at night\nI wear my sunglasses at night\nI wear my sunglasses at night\nI say it to you now\nI wear my sunglasses at night\nI wear my sunglasses at night\nI wear my sunglasses at night\nI cry to you\nI wear my sunglasses at night\nI wear my sunglasses at night

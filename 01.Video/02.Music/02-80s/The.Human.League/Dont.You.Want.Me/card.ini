[lyrics]
orig = You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar\nWhen I met you\nI picked you out, I shook you up\nAnd turned you around\nTurned you into someone new\nNow five years later on you've got the world at your feet\nSuccess has been so easy for you\nBut don't forget it's me who put you where you are now\nAnd I can put you back down too.\n\nDon't. Don't you want me?\nYou know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me\nDon't. Don't you want me?\nYou know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me\n\nIt's much too late to find\nWhen you think you've changed your mind\nYou'd better change it back or we will both be sorry\n\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\n\nI was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar\nThat much is true\nBut even then I knew I'd find a much better place\nEither with or without you\nThe five years we have had have been such good at times\nI still love you\nBut now I think it's time I live my life on my own\nI guess it's just what I must do\n\nDon't. Don't you want me?\nYou know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me\nDon't. Don't you want me?\nYou know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me\n\nIt's much too late to find\nWhen you think you've changed your mind\nYou'd better change it back or we will both be sorry\n\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\n\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\n\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\n\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!\nDon't you want me, baby?\nDon't you want me? Oh!

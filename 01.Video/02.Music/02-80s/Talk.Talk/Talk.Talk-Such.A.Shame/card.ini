en = Such a shame to believe in escape\nA life on every face\nAnd that's a change\n'Til I'm finally left with an eight\nTell me to relax, I just stare\nMaybe I don't know if I should change\nA feeling that we share\nIt's a shame\n\n(Such a shame)\nNumber me with rage, it's a shame\n(Such a shame)\nNumber me in haste (such a shame)\nThis eagerness to change\nIt's a shame\n\nThe dice decide my fate\nAnd that's a shame\nIn these trembling hands\nMy faith tells me to react, I don't care\nMaybe it's unkind that I should change\nA feeling that we share\nIt's a shame\n\n(Such a shame)\nNumber me with rage, it's a shame\n(Such a shame)\nNumber me in haste (such a shame)\nThis eagerness to change\nSuch a shame\n\nTell me to relax, I just stare\nMaybe I don't know if I should change\nA feeling that we share\nIt's a shame\n\n(Such a shame)\nNumber me with rage, it's a shame\n(Such a shame)\nNumber me in haste, it's a shame\n(Such a shame)\nWrite it across my name\n(Such a shame)\nThis eagerness to change\n\nSuch a shame

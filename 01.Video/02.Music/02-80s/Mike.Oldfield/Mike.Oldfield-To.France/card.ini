orig = Taking on water, sailing a restless sea\nFrom a memory, a fantasy\nThe wind carries into white water\nFar from the islands\nDon't you know you're...\n\nNever going to get to France\nMary Queen of Chance will they find you\nNever going to get to France\nCould a new romance ever bind you\n\nWalking on foreign ground like a shadow\nRoaming in far off territory\nOver your shoulder stories unfold\nYou're searching for sanctuary\nYou know you're...\n\nNever going to get to France\nMary Queen of Chance will they find you\nNever going to get to France\nCould a new romance ever bind you\n\nI see a picture\nBy the lamp's flicker\nIsn't it strange how\nDreams fade and shimmer\n\nNever going to get to France\nMary Queen of Chance will they find you\nNever going to get to France\nCould a new romance ever bind you\n\nI see a picture\nBy the lamp's flicker\nIsn't it strange how\nDreams fade and shimmer\n\nNever going to get to France\nMary Queen of Chance will they find you\nNever going to get to France\nCould a new romance ever bind you\n\nNever going to get to France\nNever going to...

[lyrics]
orig = The last that ever she saw him\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nHe passed on worried and warning\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nLost in a riddle that Saturday night\nFar away on the other side\nHe was caught in the middle of a desperate fight\nAnd she couldn't find how to push through\n\nThe trees that whisper in the evening\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nSing a song of sorrow and grieving\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nAll she saw was a silhouette of a gun\nFar away on the other side\nHe was shot six times by a man on the run\nAnd she couldn't find how to push through\n\nI stay, I pray\nSee you in Heaven far away\nI stay, I pray\nSee you in Heaven one day\n\nFour A.M. in the morning\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nI watched your vision forming\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nA star was glowing in the silvery night\nFar away on the other side\nWill you come to talk to me this night\nBut she couldn't find how to push through\n\nI stay, I pray\nSee you in Heaven far away\nI stay, I pray\nSee you in Heaven one day\n\nFar away on the other side\nCaught in the middle of a hundred and five\nThe night was heavy and the air was alive\nBut she couldn't find how to push through\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nCarried away by a moonlight shadow\nFar away on the other side

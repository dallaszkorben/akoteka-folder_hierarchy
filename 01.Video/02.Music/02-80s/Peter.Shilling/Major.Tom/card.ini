orig = Standing there alone, the ship is waiting\nAll systems are go, are you sure?\nControl is not convinced\nBut the computer has the evidence\nNo need to abort\nThe countdown starts\nWatching in a trance, the crew is certain\nNothing left to chance, all is working\nTrying to relax, up in the capsule\n"Send me up a drink", jokes Major Tom\nThe count goes on\n4, 3, 2, 1\nEarth below us\nDrifting falling\nFloating weightless\nCalling calling home\nSecond stage is cut, we're now in orbit\nStabilizers up, running perfect\nStarting to collect, requested data\nWhat will it effect, when all is done\nThinks Major Tom\nBack at ground control, there is a problem\nGo to rockets full, not responding\nHello Major Tom, are you receiving\nTurn the thrusters on, we're standing by\nThere's no reply\n4, 3, 2, 1\nEarth below us\nDrifting, falling\nFloating, weightless\nCalling, calling, home\nAcross the stratosphere\nA final message, "Give my wife my love"\nThen nothing more\nFar beneath the ship, the world is mourning\nThey don't realize, he's alive\nNo one understands but Major Tom sees\nNow the light commands, this is my home\nI'm coming home\nEarth below us\nDrifting falling\nFloating weightless\nComing home\nEarth below us\nDrifting falling\nFloating weightless\nComing home\nEarth below us\nDrifting falling\nFloating weightless\nComing coming home\nHome

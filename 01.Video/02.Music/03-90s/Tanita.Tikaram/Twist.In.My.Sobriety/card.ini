[lyrics]
orig = All God's children need traveling shoes\nDrive your problems from here\nAll good people read good books\nNow your conscience is clear\nI hear you talk girl\nNow your conscience is clear\nIn the morning I wipe my brow\nWipe the miles away\nI like to think I can be so willed\nAnd never do what you say\nI'll never hear you\nAnd never do what you say\nLook my eyes are just holograms\nLook your love has drawn red from my hands\nFrom my hands you know you'll never be\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nWe just poked a little empty pie\nFor the fun people had at night\nLate at night don't need hostility\nTimid smile and pause to free\nI don't care about their different thoughts\nDifferent thoughts are good for me\nUp in arms and chaste and whole\nAll God's children took their toll\nLook my eyes are just holograms\nLook your love has drawn red from my hands\nFrom my hands you know you'll never be\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nCup of tea, take time to think, yea\nTime to risk a life, a life, a life\nSweet and handsome\nSoft and porky\nYou pig out 'til you've seen the light\nPig out 'til you've seen the light\nHalf the people read the papers\nRead them good and well\nPretty people, nervous people\nPeople have got to sell\nNews you have to sell\nLook my eyes are just holograms\nLook your love has drawn red from my hands\nFrom my hands you know you'll never be\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nLook my eyes are just holograms\nLook your love has drawn red from my hands\nFrom my hands you know you'll never be\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nMore than twist in my sobriety\nMore than twist in my sobriety

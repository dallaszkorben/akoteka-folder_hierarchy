orig = Extreme ways are back again\nExtreme places I didn't know\nI broke everything new again\nEverything that I'd owned\nI threw it out the windows, came along\nExtreme ways I know move apart The colors of my sea\nPerfect color me\nExtreme ways that help me\nThat help me out late at night\nExtreme places I had gone\nBut never seen any light\nDirty basements, dirty noise\nDirty places coming through\nExtreme worlds alone\nDid you ever like it then\nI would stand in line for this\nThere's always room in life for this\nOh baby, oh baby\nThen it fell apart, it fell apart\nOh baby, oh baby\nThen it fell apart, it fell apart\nExtreme songs that told me\nThey helped me down every night\nI didn't have much to say\nI didn't get above the light\nI closed my eyes and closed myself\nAnd closed my world and never opened\nUp to anything\nThat could get me along\nI had to close down everything\nI had to close down my mind\nToo many things to cover me\nToo much can make me blind\nI've seen so much in so many places\nSo many heartaches, so many faces\nSo many dirty things\nYou couldn't even believe\nI would stand in line for this\nIt's always good in life for this\nOh baby, oh baby\nThen it fell apart, it fell apart\nAll day, all day\nThen it fell apart, it fell apart\n(Falling apart) \nIt's a Monday morning, it's everywhere\nOh no I can't\nAll day, all day\nThen it fell apart, it fell apart\nAll day, all day\nThen it fell apart, it fell apart\nAll day, all day\nThen it fell apart, it fell apart\nAll day, all day\nLike it always does, always does

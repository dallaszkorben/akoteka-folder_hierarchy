[lyrics]
orig = In my dreams I'm dying all the time\nThen I wake it's kaleidoscopic mind\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to lie\nSo this is goodbye?\nThis is goodbye\nTell the truth, you've never wanted me\nTell me\nIn my dreams I'm jealous all the time\nWhen I wake I'm going out of my mind\nGoing out of my mind

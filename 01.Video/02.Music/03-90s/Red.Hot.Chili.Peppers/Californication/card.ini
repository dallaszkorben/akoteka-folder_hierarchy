[lyrics]
orig = Psychic spies from China\nTry to steal your mind's elation\nLittle girls from Sweden\nDream of silver screen quotations\nAnd if you want these kind of dreams\nIt's Californication\n\nIt's the edge of the world\nAnd all of western civilization\nThe sun may rise in the East\nAt least it settles in the final location\nIt's understood that Hollywood\nSells Californication\n\nPay your surgeon very well\nTo break the spell of aging\nCelebrity skin is this your chin\nOr is that war you're waging?\n\nFirst born unicorn\nHard core soft porn\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication\n\nMarry me girl be my fairy to the world\nBe my very own constellation\nA teenage bride with a baby inside\nGetting high on information\nAnd buy me a star on the boulevard\nIt's Californication\n\nSpace may be the final frontier\nBut it's made in a Hollywood basement\nCobain can you hear the spheres\nSinging songs off station to station\nAnd Alderaan's not far away\nIt's Californication\n\nBorn and raised by those who praise\nControl of population everybody's been there and\nI don't mean on vacation\n\nFirst born unicorn\nHard core soft porn\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication\n\nDestruction leads to a very rough road\nBut it also breeds creation\nAnd earthquakes are to a girl's guitar\nThey're just another good vibration\nAnd tidal waves couldn't save the world\nFrom Californication\n\nPay your surgeon very well\nTo break the spell of aging\nSicker than the rest\nThere is no test\nBut this is what you're craving\n\nFirst born unicorn\nHard core soft porn\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication\nDream of Californication

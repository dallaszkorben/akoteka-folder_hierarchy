[lyrics]
orig = I'm tired of telling the story\nTired of telling it your way\nYeh I know what I saw\nI know that I found the floor\n\nBefore you take my heart, reconsider\nBefore you take my heart, reconsider\nI've opened the door\nI've opened the door\n\nHere comes the summer's son\nHe burns my skin\nI ache again\nI'm over you\n\nI thought I had a dream to hold\nMaybe that has gone\nYour hands reach out and touch me still\nBut this feels so wrong\n\nBefore you take my heart, reconsider\nBefore you take my heart, reconsider\nI've opened the door\nI've opened the door\n\nHere comes the summer's son\nHe burns my skin\nI ache again\nI'm over you\n\nBefore you take my heart, reconsider\nBefore you take my heart, reconsider\nI've opened the door\nI've opened the door\n\nHere comes the summer's son\nHe burns my skin\nI ache again\nI'm over you\n\nHere comes the winter's rain\nTo cleanse my skin\nI wake again\nI'm over you\n\nHere comes the summer's son\nHe burns my skin\nI ache again\nI'm over you\n\nHere comes the winter's rain\nTo cleanse my skin\nI wake again\nI'm over you\n\nI'm over you

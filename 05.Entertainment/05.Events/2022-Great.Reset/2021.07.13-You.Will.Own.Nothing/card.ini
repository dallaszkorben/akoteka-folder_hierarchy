[storyline]
orig = This is a creepy commerical that the World Economic Forum posted and removed from Youtube and Twitter. The World Economic Forum also known as the Davos Group is a consortium of government officials and corporate leaders.\nJustin Trudeau is one of WEF Young Emerging Leaders\n\nTheir Great Reset agenda in the commerical proposes a future scenario where:\n\n1. You'll own nothing and you'll be happy. You'll rent everything and it will be delivered by drone.\n\nHere is a quote from their article on the subject:\n\n"In our city we don't pay any rent, because someone else is using our free space whenever we do not need it. My living room is used for business meetings when I am not there."\n\n2. The U.S. won't be the World Superpower, a handful of countries will dominate.\n\nThe World economic Forum wants to dissolve national sovereignty and set up a world government system. \n\n3. You won't die waiting for an organ donor. We won't transplant organs, we will 3d print them instead.\n\n4. You'll eat Much less meat. It will be an occasional treat, not a staple.\n\n5. A billion people will be displaced by climate change. We'll have to do a better job of welcoming refugees.\n\n6. Polluters will have pay to emit carbon dioxide.\n\nCarbon tax.\n\n7. Scientists have worked out how to make you healthy in space. The start of journey to find alien life.\n\n8. Western values will be tested to the breaking point. Checks and balances that undermine our democracies must not be forgotten.\n\nKlaus schwab \nBlackrock Larry Fink \nResetwars.com\nResetwars

00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,430
Hey, everyone Dr. Z,
welcome to The ZDoggMD Show.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,210
Today I have a special guest

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,570
look, I moved back to the Bay Area,

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,410
so I could talk to smart people

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,150
at places like UCSF and
Stanford and in the Bay area.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,070
And I was all excited and then COVID hit

7
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,950
and it was Zoom, Zoom,
Zoom, and I hate Zoom.

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,850
So today I have someone
I've been wanting to talk to

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,860
since this pandemic started,

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,410
Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is a
Stanford Professor of Medicine

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,040
and he has training and
specialty in economics.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,970
Actually tell me Jay

13
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,173
Jay, who are you man?

14
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:32,920
- Well, okay.

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,100
- Not in a metaphysical sense.

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,930
- Exactly, so I am a Professor
of Medicine as you said

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,890
at Stanford university,

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,120
I've been at Stanford on the
faculty for about 20 years.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,660
I've an MD and a PhD in Economics.

20
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,620
And I studied health policy
and health economics.

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,220
I've been working on infectious disease,

22
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,360
economics and epidemiology

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,060
for 20 some years now.

24
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,540
- So the reason I wanted
to have you on the show

25
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,960
was what you just said.

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,560
You have the MD Stanford
training and PhD in economics,

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,520
which means you can see in a way

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,160
that many frontline healthcare people,

29
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,600
including public health people,

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,030
aren't able to see the bigger picture.

31
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,804
Now you came to prominence
during the pandemic

32
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:13,470
as one of the coauthors

33
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,170
of the Stanford Seroprevalence Study,

34
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,380
which raised all kinds of interesting.

35
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,680
I mean, tell me about that experience

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,280
because I was talking
about your piece early on

37
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,380
saying, hey, this is true.

38
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,380
The actual infection
fatality rate of this disease

39
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,470
is actually much lower than we thought

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,010
it's still higher than flu,

41
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,150
but it's not as high as
they've been saying in China.

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,566
What was that experience like?

43
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,010
- I mean, that was incredible.

44
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,660
Just an amazing, in
some ways, dispiriting,

45
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,680
but also exciting experience.

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,440
Let me kind of go back just a little bit?

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,370
- [Dr. Z] Absolutely.

48
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,788
- So what got me into it

49
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:49,580
was I had done some work

50
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,670
during the H1N1 Flu epidemic in 2009.

51
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,503
- [Dr. Z] I remember that one.

52
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:55,500
- I mean, it was a big
deal at the time, right?

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,430
But luckily it didn't turn
out to be as bad as COVID,

54
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,680
but especially at the beginning,

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,260
people were really, really panicked

56
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,690
over the high fatality rates

57
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,140
that were the case fatality rates

58
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,810
that were coming up out
of all around the world.

59
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,690
- I remember I was a practicing
hospitalist at Stanford

60
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,460
and everybody was like,
we're all going to die.

61
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,600
It was a kind of a catastrophization.

62
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,935
- Yeah, it's actually
an in the early days,

63
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:17,768
there was good reason.

64
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:19,160
There were these case fatality rates

65
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,998
that looked like Ebola.

66
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:23,298
It just did look terrible.

67
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,020
In the months that followed

68
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,170
what happened was people
did zero prevalence studies

69
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,003
and found that

70
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:33,560
there were many times
more cases of infections

71
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,930
than there had been cases in H1N1

72
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,610
and the infection fatality rate,

73
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,970
which turned out to be
about a hundred times less

74
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,540
than the initial case fatality
rates in the H1N1 case.

75
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,610
- So let me reiterate that for people

76
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,190
who don't understand
some of the terminology.

77
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,610
So case fatality rate is when someone

78
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,700
is actually tested for
disease, presents to care

79
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,480
and is diagnosed with the disease,

80
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,200
and then how many people
die out of that group.

81
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,130
- [Dr. Jay] Correct.

82
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,450
- Infection fatality rate

83
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,280
is, well, of all the
infections that exist,

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
including ones that we weren't
able to openly diagnose.

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,300
What's the rate of fatality in that group.

86
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,180
And it was 100X different in H1N1.

87
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,040
- [Dr. Jay] In H1N1 that's right.

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,670
- And so this got you interested then

89
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,560
when COVID came around, I imagine.

90
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,530
- It looked like a repeat to me, right?

91
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,300
So looked like the people were finding

92
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,770
enormously high case fatality rates.

93
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,732
I think World Health
Organization said 3.4%.

94
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:29,640
There was a piece published
in JAMA in February

95
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,480
Journal of American Medical
Association, that said 2.2%.

96
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,060
And these are terrible numbers.

97
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,695
- These are horrifying numbers.

98
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,000
These are the kind of
numbers that would cause you

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,750
to lock down the entire planet instantly,

100
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,090
because you're gonna lose

101
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,450
that percentage of your population

102
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,678
if everybody gets infected.

103
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:47,910
- Millions and millions
of people dead, right

104
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,360
if that's the number in
the United States alone.

105
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,193
- [Dr. Z] Alone.

106
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:52,703
- If the numbers are right.

107
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,753
But that was what happened at H1N1.

108
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:57,810
And I said okay, well, do we really know

109
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,434
how many people actually have it?

110
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:01,960
And at the same time we're worried

111
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,912
about how much testing resources we had.

112
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,450
Remember there was a shortage of tests.

113
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,082
So we're just holding onto the test

114
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,120
to look at people who
actually have serious disease,

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,480
which is what you ought to do
from a clinical perspective.

116
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,270
But then from an
epidemiologic perspective,

117
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,640
can you extrapolate that

118
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,680
to say, okay the population at large

119
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,143
3% of us are all gonna die if we get it.

120
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,840
And we don't have the answer to that.

121
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,210
So that's what led to the
Stanford Seroprevalence Study.

122
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,043
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

123
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:29,650
- And the other share problem
studies I've worked on.

124
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,666
So it was this hypothesis.

125
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,540
Like how many people actually have it?

126
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,210
How deadly actually is it?

127
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,520
- And so how did you do this study?

128
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,280
Because there was a ton of
controversy around the methods

129
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,250
and the actual sensitivity specificity

130
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,150
of the assay that you use and all that.

131
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,650
- Yeah, so that was a lot
of confusion around that.

132
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,830
So we wanted to do a study

133
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,530
that could be done very, very quickly,

134
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,149
put it in the field very, very quickly.

135
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:56,544
At the time of the study

136
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:59,450
the FDA had approved for use

137
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,980
some, the lateral flow assays,

138
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,190
they looked like pregnancy tests,

139
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,560
like little pregnancy kits.

140
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:09,440
The one we used had pretty
good error properties.

141
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,080
You know every medical test has errors.

142
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,370
I mean, there's just not a,

143
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,070
and you can't avoid that.

144
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,087
That's just the nature of,

145
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:16,570
we don't have a tri-corder

146
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,040
that can automatically tell me exactly

147
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,243
what's wrong with you, right?

148
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:23,743
We need to look at the
numbers and interpret them.

149
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,040
At the time the FDA had approved for use

150
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,940
these little lateral assayed tests,

151
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,630
including the one we use, for sale

152
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,740
but they hadn't approved them

153
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,133
for general use in the population.

154
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:39,320
We could use them for research purposes,

155
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,820
but not for clinical purposes.

156
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,453
So we use one of those, the
reason it was very simple.

157
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,750
There are two kinds of tests
to do antibody testing,

158
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,060
there's these ELISA tests,
which are pretty accurate

159
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,640
and then these lateral flow assay tests.

160
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
For the ELISA's, you have
to draw venous blood.

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,290
It's really hard in the
middle of a pandemic

162
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,600
to go out and find,

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,750
you know, can I draw
venous blood from you?

164
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,970
A big vial of it,

165
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,160
or I can just do a little finger stick.

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,820
The nice thing about epidemiologic work

167
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,860
is that you can correct for the errors,

168
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,910
which is what we did.

169
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,980
Actually I've run three
Seroprevalence Studies,

170
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,970
one in Santa Clara
County, one in LA County,

171
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,555
and one in with Major League Baseball.

172
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:20,933
- Did you get to meet a
lot of baseball players?

173
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:23,600
- I got to meet a lot
of, not baseball players,

174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,080
I mean it was surreal,

175
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,910
I got to be in a meeting
with all the owners.

176
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,743
It was just--

177
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:29,699
- [Dr. Z] Oh, wow, that's nice.

178
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,216
- It was fantastic.

179
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:32,670
I had to contain myself when
I met the Yankee's owner,

180
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,432
but, you know, that's another thing.

181
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,880
So I ran three different studies

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,630
and the interesting
thing about the studies

183
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,520
was we use very different methods

184
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,660
to try to disseminate them.

185
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,873
So the Santa Clara
Study was the first one.

186
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,370
It was a big study, 2000
some people in the Bay area

187
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,850
in Santa Clara County.

188
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,683
- [Dr. Z] Right.

189
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,810
- We wrote the study very
quickly and we released it

190
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,410
through an open science process,

191
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,243
- Like a pre print,

192
00:07:00,243 --> 00:07:01,270
- A pre print, right, exactly.

193
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,150
So now the traditional path

194
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,880
involves sending it to a journal.

195
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,906
The journal then sends it to
three anonymous reviewers.

196
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,230
No one will hear it about it, except me.

197
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,570
And that's how I spend

198
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,420
my life dealing with this
three anonymous reviews,

199
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,770
all of them always hate me.

200
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,410
- So you're not used to the
whole planet hating you at once.

201
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,750
- Yeah, that was interesting.

202
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,740
So we sent it and I got 10,000
peer reviews in one day.

203
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,660
- [Dr. Z] Oh my gosh.

204
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,460
- And it was kind of
interesting, exciting.

205
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,840
I learned a lot.

206
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,200
So we made, what I would characterize

207
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,740
a relatively minor error in
standard error calculation,

208
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,580
which we corrected within a week.

209
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,413
- [Dr. Z] Right.

210
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:45,030
- And the number that we
got was absolutely stunning.

211
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,080
What we found was that the disease

212
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,350
was 50 times more prevalent

213
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,230
than people thought based
on just the case number.

214
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,730
So people thought in Santa Clara County,

215
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,940
there were a 1000 cases as of April 3rd,

216
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,310
I think it was.

217
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,420
But in fact based on the study,

218
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,777
you could tell 50,000 people

219
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:02,350
had, had some antibody
evidence of it the same time.

220
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,220
- Right, which would correspond

221
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,070
to an infection fatality rate

222
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,600
at that time of what?

223
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,010
- About two in 1,000.

224
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,964
- [Dr. Z] two in a 1,000
- So that means

225
00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:11,640
out of the 1,000 people

226
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,040
who got the infection, 998 survived.

227
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,244
- So 0.2%.
- 0.2%.

228
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:19,849
- So double what we think
the mortality is for flu.

229
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,630
- Well I am not 100% sure I
know what the flu mortality,

230
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,870
I know the evidence, it's unclear in flu

231
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,710
no one's done the same

232
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,150
kind of infection fatality rate numbers

233
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,503
that they've done with for COVID

234
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:29,770
that they've dealt with the flu.

235
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,510
- So in many ways we're
comparing apples to oranges

236
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,342
when we're comparing flu--

237
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,389
- So let's come back
to that flu comparison.

238
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,470
'Cause it is interesting and important,

239
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,710
but I think the key thing

240
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,150
is how much would you change your life '

241
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,473
for two in a 1,000 risk?

242
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,040
And there's a couple
other things we learned.

243
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,330
So one is that if you're
older, it's much higher.

244
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,730
It's probably much worse
than the flu actually.

245
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,580
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.
- For older

246
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,693
- Order of magnitude.

247
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,180
- So if you're over 70

248
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,645
versus if you're let's say
you're under 15 or under 10.

249
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:02,480
It's on the order of a
1000 to one difference

250
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,730
in mortality probability.

251
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,440
So the flu is much more
deadly if you're older,

252
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,980
if you're over let's say 65 or 70.

253
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,890
And if you're under--

254
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,920
- The flu or COVID we are talking about?

255
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,750
- I'm sorry COVID I apologize.

256
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,370
It's COVID is much more deadly
if you're over 65 or 70,

257
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,573
and if you're under say
40, the flu is worse.

258
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,290
That's what seroprevalence studies shows.

259
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,100
- And that was the sense that
I was getting early on too.

260
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,900
And seroprevalence study
was supporting that.

261
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,830
And you said something which
we're gonna get back to.

262
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,900
I think that's a theme of this,

263
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,120
how much would you change your life

264
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,340
for a two in a 1000 chance, right?

265
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,890
- Yeah and I think that age
difference is important.

266
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,080
The absolute number is also important

267
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,170
well, let's get back to that theme.

268
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,252
- Yeah , absolute versus
relative risk, yeah.

269
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:50,840
- So the interesting thing about that,

270
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,220
so we released the LA County Study.

271
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,980
It was immediately accepted
in JAMA and published.

272
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,813
- Just instant.
- It's the same number

273
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:57,791
- Peer reviewed.
- Peer reviewed, yeah.

274
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,600
I've never had such an
easy time with a review

275
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,700
it was a very strange.

276
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,780
Whereas the Santa Clara
Study, it exploded Twitter.

277
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,930
I'm not on Twitter myself.

278
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,763
- Thank God for you.

279
00:10:08,763 --> 00:10:11,210
- It was actually probably
good for my sanity.

280
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,043
- It really is.

281
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,530
- And everyone on earth

282
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,830
was paying attention to it
all at once, one study, right.

283
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,310
- [Dr. Z] Right, pre print.

284
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,510
- And everyone was convinced
that I was absolutely wrong.

285
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,343
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

286
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:27,030
- 100% wrong because people
had fixed in their mind,

287
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,628
New York City where the
death rate was higher.

288
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:32,530
Actually we know from
seroprevalence studies

289
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,363
that it was higher,

290
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:34,370
the actual infection fatality rate

291
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,770
was higher in New York City.

292
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,760
So now since then 50 some studies

293
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,510
from around the world have been done.

294
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,410
And there's a consistent theme

295
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,640
that the infection fatality rates

296
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,430
somewhere between two and three in 1,000,

297
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,850
just like what we found in Santa Clara,

298
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,430
just like what we found in LA County

299
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,090
and the places that have higher density

300
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,410
where you think did worse,

301
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,270
you know, Bergamot, New
York City, they did worse.

302
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,810
Their infection fatality rate is worse

303
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,510
five in a 1,000, six in a 1,000

304
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,800
in some Spain, maybe 10 in a 1,000.

305
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,360
- So, okay, there's a lot here.

306
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,130
And again, this gets me fired up

307
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,330
because I've been talking
about this myself,

308
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,270
why would an infection
fatality rate be different

309
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,790
in say New York versus at Santa Clara?

310
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,710
Walk me through that.

311
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,280
- Yeah, sure so we think

312
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,890
about infection fatality rate

313
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,500
as if it were just a--
- [Dr. Z] Static.

314
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,830
- Well, as if it's the virus itself,

315
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,950
it's a feature of the virus.

316
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,783
Here's the virus.

317
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:36,840
Here's the infection fatality rate.

318
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,293
That's wrong thinking.

319
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,770
It's a function of the virus obviously,

320
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,603
the biology of the virus,

321
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,450
but also the host

322
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,060
and also of the healthcare system

323
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,620
taking care of the patient.

324
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,100
- Do they survive or do they care

325
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,147
- All three of those things matter a ton.

326
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:53,440
- [Dr. Z] Ah.

327
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,273
- So for instance,

328
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:56,550
if you look at the case
fatality rate for this disease,

329
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,362
just case fatality forget about
infection fatality, right?

330
00:11:58,362 --> 00:11:59,780
This is the number of
people who have the disease

331
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,000
who actually died from it.

332
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,830
It's declined very sharply
since March and April.

333
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,867
- Sure has, cases up deaths down.

334
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:07,810
- Has the virus changed?

335
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,170
Maybe a little, I mean,
there's some mutation,

336
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,250
but not enough to think

337
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,258
that it's had any appreciable change.

338
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:14,450
What it is, is a few things.

339
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,140
One is the set of people
that are getting infected

340
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,540
are less vulnerable to it.

341
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,093
They tend to be younger.

342
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:22,807
And so they just don't die
at higher rates from it.

343
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:24,900
The second we were better at managing it,

344
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,990
better treating it.

345
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,865
- Right, dexamethasone.

346
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:28,698
- [Dr. Jay] Exactly.

347
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:29,750
- Not intubating everyone.

348
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,040
- Not killing people
with ventilators right.

349
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,960
I mean that would seem
like a really good idea.

350
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,500
- Yeah which by the way,

351
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,510
wasn't clear in the beginning at all.

352
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,830
So not to disparage people
who are intubating everyone,

353
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,960
but we just didn't know.

354
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,010
- Yeah, I know, look, I
have a lot of sympathy

355
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,770
and people were really brave going in

356
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,130
when we didn't have the numbers.

357
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,083
I honor that, absolutely.

358
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,190
But it is absolutely the case,

359
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,480
we've learned a lot about
how to treat the disease

360
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,827
and we're much better at
managing than we once we're.

361
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:02,320
I think that kind of news
ought to get out more.

362
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,950
That seems like an important fact,

363
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,060
our understanding of
disease shouldn't be frozen

364
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,700
in Amber, in March.

365
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,310
- No, so you're appreciated the choir

366
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,490
because I just did a video on this,

367
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,290
on the cases up deaths down.

368
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,260
I actually think that there is a lot

369
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,520
of catastrophization and misunderstanding,

370
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,380
and there's been a polarity

371
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,130
that I've not seen in science ever.

372
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:25,655
And the thing is folks like you,

373
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:28,890
this is the thing I
criticized your trial as well,

374
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,180
but also put it out there

375
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,280
and said, hey, this is what's going on.

376
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,950
This is the critique, et cetera.

377
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,783
- Well, science, that's how it works.

378
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,353
- That's what you do in science.

379
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:37,547
- I mean, I didn't mind the science.

380
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:38,886
of course we talk,

381
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,910
we look at the data,
we try to interpret it.

382
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,400
That's the fun part of science.

383
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,670
- But the vitriol and the censorship too,

384
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,360
like Ioniddis is your partner in that

385
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,430
one of the most respected scientists

386
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,180
actually has done papers
and papers and papers

387
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,630
on how we get science wrong
with our own biases, right.

388
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,040
Was accused of severe bias and censored.

389
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,004
- Yeah, it was absolutely shocking.

390
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:05,627
So, like Buzzfeed attack
my family, Buzzfeed.

391
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,440
- Can I say, so anytime I
see anything in Buzzfeed,

392
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,480
if it isn't 10 reasons
celebrities have done something

393
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,290
that make you go, what I'm shook!

394
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,500
I don't listen to it because
it's so clearly biased.

395
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,857
- Yeah, it was really kind of

396
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:22,450
- Buzzfeed attacked your family?

397
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,930
- Yeah they said my wife was involved

398
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,170
in like she volunteered,

399
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,002
my daughter actually volunteered as a,

400
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,580
it was lot of community involvement

401
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,300
with the feeling around
the study in Santa Clara

402
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,760
was a lot of volunteers

403
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,593
a lot of people,

404
00:14:33,593 --> 00:14:35,007
it was a really good feeling.

405
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,650
And my wife was super
excited about the study.

406
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,880
She's an oncologist.

407
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,170
She wrote a email and to her friends,

408
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,750
encouraging them to sign up

409
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,380
and somebody leaked the email,

410
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,820
which had some information
that was not quite right.

411
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,440
And then Buzzfeed made
her international news.

412
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,135
- [Dr. Z] Oh my God.

413
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:53,017
- That's the hardest part of this.

414
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,880
It was just getting my
family involved with it

415
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,943
in a way that I didn't expect.

416
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,943
- What's the agenda for that,

417
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:04,410
that you're somehow
minimizing the pandemic

418
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,360
and gonna cost lives, is that right?

419
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,113
- I think so, that's part of it.

420
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,690
The same Buzzfeed author
then wrote an accusation

421
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,100
that somehow, because people gave money,

422
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,250
including like, I guess
a JetBlue executive

423
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,000
- Right, I saw that.
- [Dr. Jay] To Stanford

424
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,770
- Right, right 5000 bucks.

425
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,779
- [Dr. Jay] 5,000,

426
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,480
- So 5000 which is a rounding
error on the cost of a trial.

427
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,770
- Well, in this case, the study was

428
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,300
we ran a really cheap,

429
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,230
it was less than a $100,000 for the study.

430
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,436
- [Dr. Z] Nice.

431
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:33,830
- But they give the money to Stanford

432
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,910
and somehow I'm gonna
change the results for the,

433
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,760
it's just ridiculous.

434
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,980
- You know what,

435
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,040
Jay, when you're in big JetBlue's pocket

436
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,873
anything goes wrong

437
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:44,907
- It was really kind of him
to give money for thE study

438
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:46,320
was like, I'm grateful.

439
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,410
- And that's fine that
he had his own agenda,

440
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,570
which was probably, hey, yeah.

441
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,403
- Everyone has an agenda

442
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:51,320
- [Dr. Z] Everyone has an agenda.

443
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,615
- So my agenda was to
learn what that number was.

444
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:57,330
I think we now know it.

445
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,220
- So your feeling now is that somewhere

446
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,190
between 0.2 and 0.3%

447
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,077
infection fatality rates.

448
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,717
- That's the median around the world

449
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,550
- Median, around the world,

450
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,094
It may be higher in
places like a New York.

451
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:11,927
- [Dr. Jay] Yeah.

452
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,910
- Why was it higher in
New York, do you think?

453
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,810
- I think there's lots of reasons.

454
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,063
I think potential one is
I think the set of people

455
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,500
that were infected in New York were older.

456
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,537
And the institutions
where they are infected

457
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:25,210
was less capable of dealing with it

458
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,060
in the early days of the epidemic.

459
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,715
So there's something to this

460
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:31,681
and the fact that it was older people

461
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,670
in nursing home settings

462
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,420
that weren't sort of
equipped to manage it.

463
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,670
I think that played a big role

464
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,010
in why it was higher in New York.

465
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,280
The other thing is I think there's a,

466
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,810
and this is a theory I've seen,

467
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,099
I think, I mean, there's something to it,

468
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,170
when viral load is higher,

469
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,010
when you're exposed to it

470
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,714
multiple times over and over again,

471
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:51,170
you just get a worse outcome.

472
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,810
So I talked about this with
Monica Gandhi yesterday

473
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,650
on the show UCSF ID doc,

474
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,460
and her theory of viral inoculum
correlating to severity.

475
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,293
- I saw that.

476
00:17:00,293 --> 00:17:02,640
- Yeah, yeah and she actually posited

477
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,691
the same exact thing in,

478
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:07,270
it's a theory like it's
was hypothesis in New York

479
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,940
was that people are in
the built environment

480
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,200
or on top of each other,

481
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,670
especially minority communities,

482
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,650
which were hardest hit.

483
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,990
And so, as a result, if you're
out in Queens or somewhere,

484
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,364
and you're just living
in this multifamily home,

485
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:21,660
told to stay in doors, right.

486
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,492
What are you doing?

487
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:24,108
You get a high viral inoculum.

488
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,819
And again, it's a hypothesis,

489
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,989
but it's interesting
because that would affect

490
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,480
your infection fatality ratio

491
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,850
if that is a component of
how severely ill you get.

492
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,630
- Correct and that is what explains

493
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,043
why nosocomial spreads
like hospital's spread

494
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:40,230
it's so important.
- Exactly.

495
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,230
We talked Dr. Li, the guy,
the ophthalmologist in Wuhan

496
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,560
who first sort of broke this
news and he died and he was 33

497
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,570
and the thought was,
he's an ophthalmologist.

498
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,580
So he's seeing patients
this close to their face,

499
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,513
getting viral inoculum right in the face.

500
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,670
And now we've learned a lot from that.

501
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,470
that's why we in N95 and
face shield in the hospital

502
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,021
and paper and all that.

503
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:06,388
If we can yeah.

504
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:11,210
So do you think the
infection fatality ratio,

505
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,600
if you just looked at one community,

506
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,530
like say Latinos, Latinas,

507
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,103
would you think it'd be higher
there from what we're seeing?

508
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,603
- From what I've seen,

509
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,687
I think that minorities are
harder hit with this epidemic.

510
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,940
That's absolutely true.

511
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,340
So black communities, Latino
communities are been harder,

512
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,180
especially in California,

513
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,634
Latino communities make
up the bulk of the--

514
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:34,780
- Disease yeah, 45% yeah.

515
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,210
- It's incredible, I don't think

516
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,610
the infection fatality rates,
- Sorry 60%,

517
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,510
60% of cases in California

518
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,840
- But I don't think that
the infection fatality rate

519
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,230
is much higher conditional on getting it.

520
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,670
It's just they're more likely to get it.

521
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,543
- [Dr. Z] I see.

522
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:50,632
- It may be a little higher.

523
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,150
I mean, you know, it's hard to.

524
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,110
- See because is there preexisting disease

525
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,950
more in that community,

526
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,670
chronic disease, diabetes,
hypertension disease.

527
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,957
- Yeah, that's the question.

528
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:00,030
So if you have these
underlying conditions,

529
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,130
of course, you're more likely to die from,

530
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,490
if you're older you're
more likely to die from it,

531
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,914
things like that we know for a fact.

532
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:05,170
Once you control for that,

533
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,650
if you're Hispanic, are
you more likely to die?

534
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,030
My guess is probably not.

535
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,863
- [Dr. Z] Interesting.

536
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:11,530
- It's mostly those preexisting conditions

537
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,887
and the fact that you're
more likely get it

538
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,180
in the first place.

539
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,530
- Now, one counter proposal
I might say as well,

540
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,570
if viral inoculum does matter,

541
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,100
if that hypothesis is true

542
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,400
and Hispanic families are more likely

543
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,543
to congregate together under one roof,

544
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:27,322
you might see

545
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:29,590
actually a higher infection
fatality rate in that.

546
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,830
- It could be yeah.

547
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,700
There's a study that was done in Mumbai,

548
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,230
in the Dharavi Slums in Mumbai.

549
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,590
- Yes, I saw that, explain it.

550
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,820
- First, the, the prevalence was enormous.

551
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,939
I mean, I think it was like--

552
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:42,763
- It was 80%, 60 or 80.

553
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:45,460
- I actually talked to some
of those study authors,

554
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,043
the studies who ran the thing.

555
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,810
Essentially the idea they have

556
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,050
is that the lockdown put people,

557
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:58,290
this is a slum where like 10
people live in the same house

558
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,720
and there's police walking around,

559
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,940
making sure that if you
walk out of the house,

560
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,870
you're gonna be arrested.

561
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,709
So they put 10 people in the house,

562
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,760
they probably spread the
disease with the lockdown,

563
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,466
enormous viral load.

564
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:15,350
You can see with the 80%
antibody number right.

565
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,650
- Right

566
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,753
- But the infection fatality
rate was really low.

567
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:19,710
- Minuscule.

568
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,543
- [Dr.  Jay] Yeah.

569
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:22,330
- Like I think it might
be an under reporting

570
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,470
to some degree, but like 200,
300 deaths out of all these.

571
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,760
- Yeah it was really, really low.

572
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,530
So part of that is they
don't have the diabetes,

573
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,363
they don't have the obesity,

574
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,260
they don't have those kinds
of predisposing conditions.

575
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,093
- 'Cause they're thin.

576
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:35,030
- [Dr. Jay] And they're younger.

577
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,915
- They're younger.

578
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,580
- So, I think we're still learning

579
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,413
and at least I'm still
learning quite a lot

580
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:40,570
about this disease.

581
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,160
- Well, and you know the
other thought that I had,

582
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,370
and again, this is just
pure mental masturbation

583
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,980
is the idea that that group may be exposed

584
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,470
to so many pathogens on a daily basis,

585
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,050
including Corona Viruses, et cetera,

586
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,510
that they have some innate
T-cell immunity or mucosal immune

587
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,830
something that we don't have.

588
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,250
- Yeah, I think there's some evidence

589
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,700
of that even in the United States right.

590
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
- [Dr. Z] Yeah, exactly.

591
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,697
- I saw this really interesting
study where it looked at,

592
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:04,810
it was a small study

593
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,198
so I don't know if it generalizes

594
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,220
it will hold up when it's done larger,

595
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,060
but people who have young kids,

596
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,071
you know if you have young kids,

597
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,410
I have three kids

598
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,400
and when they were little
I had colds all the time.

599
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,623
People with young kids are
less likely to die from it.

600
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,730
- And that really tells you something

601
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,870
like, I remember I had
a severe cold actually

602
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,050
just in January

603
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,920
before it was really widely prevalent

604
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,990
and I never had antibody
testing or anything.

605
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,440
So I don't know if it was
COVID, but I doubt it.

606
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,540
No one else in the family was sick.

607
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,592
I caught it from a friend
who was in Las Vegas.

608
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:42,730
And I wonder whether getting those

609
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,640
really jazzes your T-cell immunity

610
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,253
kind of like getting a BCG vaccination

611
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:47,861
or something like that.

612
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:50,600
- There seems to be increasing evidence

613
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,300
that T cell mediated immunity
does matter quite a bit.

614
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:56,850
- But even talking about that

615
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,640
people are like, "stop
minimizing the catastrophe."

616
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,473
- I don't understand this,

617
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:03,395
like this is not politics to me.

618
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:06,900
This is a really important
epidemiologic phenomenon

619
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,950
that we absolutely have
to get our hands around.

620
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,100
We need the best science possible.

621
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,050
I don't understand the politicization

622
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,440
of you're on team apocalypse

623
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,270
or you're on team doom, right, team--

624
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,103
- Team denial.

625
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:20,770
- [Dr. Jay] Yeah, exactly.

626
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,340
- I liked that team apocalypse
versus team denial go!

627
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,173
That's really what it is.

628
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:28,170
And we say that we don't understand it,

629
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,270
but we do understand it's
an election year all that,

630
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,970
but as scientists, we don't condone it

631
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,010
is what we're trying to say.

632
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,320
You got sucked into it, right?

633
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,970
Because by definition
now you're on team denial

634
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,720
because you did science
that doesn't support

635
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,120
the press' narrative of X, Y, and Z.

636
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,965
- Yeah, what I was taught

637
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,730
in public health circles,

638
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,840
we actually give people
the right information,

639
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,673
the true information.

640
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,260
We don't unduly stoke panic

641
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,790
just in order to get the result we want,

642
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,550
which is essentially you're gonna comply

643
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,150
with this order or that order.

644
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,055
We don't do that.

645
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:06,493
We tell people, okay, here are the risks.

646
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,260
We have to trust people to
react to that appropriately.

647
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,980
Not many times, they won't some

648
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,510
but many times they will,

649
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,840
but on net if you wanna maintain trust

650
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,180
in the public health community,

651
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,670
the absolute first thing we have to do

652
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,160
is tell them the absolute
truth about what we know

653
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,570
and we don't know.

654
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,010
- So what you've nailed here again,

655
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,840
is something I talked with
Vinay Prasad on the show about

656
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,850
which is authenticity.

657
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,460
We suck at it in medicine,

658
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,060
we prevaricate, we think
we don't trust the public

659
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,260
to do the right thing.

660
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,350
We are paternalistic to a fault.

661
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,880
So when Monica was on the show yesterday,

662
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,500
she said, you know, I'm an HIV researcher.

663
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,800
I believe in harm reduction.

664
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,840
How dare us preach at people

665
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,790
wear mask you dummy, you stupid person.

666
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,110
And do you wanna kill grandmothers?

667
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,943
And this and this and this,

668
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:55,210
that's not the way to
communicate public health.

669
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,630
You communicate the uncertainty,

670
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,650
but you communicate what we know

671
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,827
and her whole thing as well,
if mass reduce inoculum,

672
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:02,400
and it's a low risk intervention,

673
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,140
then maybe you guys should do that.

674
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,024
But it's your decision.

675
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:06,167
I don't wanna mandate it.

676
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:09,070
And if we get 80% compliance
according to our data,

677
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,260
maybe that's a tipping point,

678
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,943
but you know, again, it's a hypothesis.

679
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,900
- I'd amend that a little bit.

680
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,150
I agree with that actually,

681
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,210
but the only thing I'd amend

682
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,370
is it's related to the harm
you really, really are seeing.

683
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,820
So if we really are seeing
it's a 3% mortality disease,

684
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,783
yeah then I'm okay with more aggressive.

685
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:31,460
But if on the other hand

686
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,690
we're really uncertain about that 3%,

687
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,523
which we were.

688
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,470
If we really don't know,

689
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,630
we should tell people,

690
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,790
look, it's looking like 3%

691
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,870
we don't know, let's see,

692
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,220
here's what we're doing
to try to figure it out.

693
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,210
We should just be honest
about what we don't know.

694
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,470
I think to me has been
the most shocking thing

695
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,320
that the public health people and doctors

696
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,390
have dawn this mantle
of absolute knowledge

697
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,955
in a place where I've read
a lot of this literature

698
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:58,260
there's a lot I don't know

699
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,340
even though I've been reading
the literature scientifically.

700
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,600
So we just don't know.

701
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,690
We should say that.

702
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,340
Why is it bad to say that
when we just don't know.

703
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,490
- You know, and what it does

704
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,670
there's a side effect of that,

705
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,980
that we're seeing now,

706
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,150
which is when doctors and
public health officials

707
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,087
say, "don't wear a mask."

708
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,757
and then yeah in the next
breath, "wear a mask of any kind.

709
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:18,590
"I don't care

710
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,550
"if it's just the lace panties
over your face wear that"

711
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,320
we look like idiots.

712
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,520
And on top of that,

713
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,750
the public then, which isn't as dumb

714
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,010
as they're portrayed by
the intellectual elite,

715
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,792
goes, "now wait a minute."

716
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:32,625
- And they should.

717
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:33,730
- And they should.

718
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,410
And then what happens is,

719
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,520
and you see it in the comments
to my own videos, right?

720
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,980
If I do a video kind of
leaning in one direction,

721
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,550
a billion people comment
the other direction.

722
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,280
If I lean in, in that other direction,

723
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,520
a billion people comment,

724
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,260
the public is trying to find truth.

725
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,093
- Right.

726
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:48,926
- [Dr. Z] And it's tough.

727
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:50,220
- I mean, you know, that's okay.

728
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,392
We're having a conversation,

729
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:53,130
there's stuff I'm learning from you.

730
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,867
I hope there's some stuff
you're learning from me.

731
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:57,500
And basically that's what science is.

732
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,150
It's a conversation
that leads to more data

733
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,203
that leads to more conversation.

734
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:02,240
That's what it is.

735
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,730
- So what you just said

736
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,080
is absolutely reasonable and rational

737
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,700
and Buzzfeed attacks your family.

738
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,750
- Yeah, so, I mean, that was tough,

739
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,650
I have to say.

740
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,483
That was probably the hardest parts

741
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:16,850
of the whole work on this

742
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,910
was just feeling like I've
dragged my family into something.

743
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,890
There's one thing to go after me.

744
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,723
It's, another thing.

745
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:24,013
Like, but in any case,
let's leave me aside.

746
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,445
So we put this paper out,

747
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:31,643
we find this number 0.2 to 0.3,

748
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:36,222
and then a whole series of
studies started coming out

749
00:26:36,222 --> 00:26:38,522
from around the world
to find the same number.

750
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,283
Many of them published,

751
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:46,690
the peer review literature I
think now has established it.

752
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,380
- So let me ask you a question though.

753
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,880
So what, two to three times a flu

754
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,120
is still catastrophic, man.

755
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,260
Well, how do you respond to that?

756
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,820
- I'd amend that, there's also no vaccine.

757
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,927
- Right no vaccine and we
didn't have treatments.

758
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:04,060
- Absolutely it is worse than
the flu for those reasons.

759
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,573
- Thank you 'cause I
think that the denial,

760
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,820
I think a lot of people perceive a denial.

761
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,180
This comparison with flu is very charged

762
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,288
and the truth is--

763
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,650
- It's worse than the flu.

764
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,880
And I think for older people,

765
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,330
it is absolutely

766
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,163
we should treat it

767
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:20,330
like it's much worse than the flu,

768
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,226
because it is worse than the flu.

769
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:25,120
So for instance, nursing homes, right?

770
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,573
So I just looked at a paper

771
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:28,460
that said that nursing homes

772
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,160
often share staff workers.

773
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,780
So like one staff worker
works in nursing A

774
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,044
may also works in nursing on B.

775
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:37,970
We should be using our testing resources

776
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,440
to make sure that when
shared staff workers

777
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,273
move back and forth,

778
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,921
they don't bring the virus

779
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:45,510
back and forth with them
across these nursing homes.

780
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,702
That seems like a completely
reasonable outcome

781
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:50,630
of the fact that older people
are much more vulnerable,

782
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,523
especially people with
comorbid conditions.

783
00:27:53,523 --> 00:27:55,320
- And you've been a big advocate

784
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,994
of protecting vulnerable groups.

785
00:27:56,994 --> 00:27:58,820
- That's the whole point of this

786
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,380
is to learn who really should we be using

787
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,887
our relatively limited
resources to protect.

788
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:08,080
And when we raise alarm,

789
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,370
who should we be doing it for.

790
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,830
There's cost to raising alarm, right?

791
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,050
So like, if I panic you,
you may take actions.

792
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,883
That's the whole point

793
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:18,635
of the raising the panic and the alarm.

794
00:28:18,635 --> 00:28:20,930
But those actions will
have very little effect

795
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,710
or much less effect on the spread

796
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,970
than the costs that you pay

797
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,650
and the society pays for those acts.

798
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,410
- And the problem with those costs

799
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,920
are they're often in tangibles,

800
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,390
like I have had fans,

801
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,720
who've become fans of my show

802
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,920
since we started the COVID adventure.

803
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,960
And the reason they became fans

804
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,040
is they have generalized anxiety disorder,

805
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,730
or they have some level of anxiety.

806
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,130
They have been jumping out of their skin,

807
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,010
watching the press
catastrophize about this

808
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,400
in generating the fear

809
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,440
that I think was the medical establishment

810
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,273
was complicit with

811
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,420
because they are seeing
it on the front lines

812
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,130
in a very biased way.

813
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,140
Oh my God, my ICU is full
of people who are dying,

814
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,313
including some young people.

815
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:04,870
And therefore anything we can do

816
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,850
to get the public to behave

817
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,120
is gonna be important, right.

818
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,290
And then what ends up happening

819
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,880
is these poor individuals

820
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,650
who have a tendency to anxiety
are losing their minds.

821
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,550
So they tell me,

822
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,270
I watch your show
because you seem rational

823
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,680
and you have opposing viewpoints,

824
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,230
and you're not just saying
we're all gonna die.

825
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,840
And I think why should I be
the one who's doing that?

826
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
- Well, you have a good audience.

827
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,960
- I think that ought to be the general.

828
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,133
- I agree with that.

829
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:35,430
I don't really understand it,

830
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,355
but it seems like people want,

831
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:41,723
especially the press seems
to want to create this panic.

832
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,076
So every time there's
a study that comes out,

833
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,890
that a child has died,

834
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,966
which has happened
absolutely for this disease.

835
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:53,970
You're gonna get this panic
headline from the press.

836
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,980
Now, one of the things I've learned

837
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,190
from the seroprevalence studies,

838
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,400
again from around the world now,

839
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,407
not just mine,

840
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:01,750
is that there's a very wide
range of clinical presentations

841
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,608
from this disease.

842
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:06,060
It ranges from, somewhere
between 30 to 40%

843
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,930
of the people that get it

844
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,460
have no symptoms whatsoever.

845
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,300
They can't remember.

846
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,133
They have the antibodies,

847
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:11,110
but they have no symptoms

848
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,610
that they can remember from it

849
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:18,220
maybe even a larger part have
relatively mild symptoms.

850
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,876
It's like a cold.

851
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:22,210
And a small fraction

852
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,760
have this horrible viral
pneumonia that kills them.

853
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,430
We focus all our attention
on the viral pneumonia

854
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,000
and none on the fact that 998 people

855
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,430
are gonna recover from it.

856
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,520
- Yeah, that's a feel good hit
of the summer, right there.

857
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,745
Like that's a positive story

858
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:39,310
and they're going to develop immunity

859
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,143
and this whole panic

860
00:30:40,143 --> 00:30:41,730
about, well, no, we're never immune.

861
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,930
That's another press thing.

862
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,740
- Yeah.
- [Dr. Z] It's insane

863
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,440
- It's like no other
virus does that, right.

864
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,197
- Exactly well, what do we all,

865
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:51,380
and the related piece to that,

866
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,389
like you said, one story about a child.

867
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,363
- HIV, I guess

868
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,070
- [Dr. Z] HIV I guess, strep throat.

869
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,670
You can't have a vaccine.

870
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,100
- So actually it's a
legitimate scientific question,

871
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,197
but one we now have an answer to.

872
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:04,140
You do develop immunity, this virus.

873
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,450
- And the thing is because
we have now millions of cases

874
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,283
and we can look

875
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,420
and there's been like, I
think two documented cases

876
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,976
of actual re-infection.

877
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:12,809
- [Dr. Jay] Yeah.

878
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,070
- One was like, it was totally mild.

879
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,394
The other was more severe.

880
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:16,830
And so you could think in a population

881
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,280
there's variants, right.

882
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,890
- But two out of millions right?

883
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,780
So, and as you said, the first case,

884
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,235
that was the reinfection,

885
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:24,520
it looked like the guy was protected.

886
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,467
- Mild, which is what you would expect,

887
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,970
even with a cold,

888
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,350
like, you get a cold one year,

889
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,570
you may get it again the next year,

890
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,280
but it's gonna be minor.

891
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,080
- Yeah, if you have the same virus,

892
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,781
even if the antibodies fade,

893
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:39,782
you may have T-cells or
other mechanisms immunity

894
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:40,615
that make it so that,

895
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:41,820
it's not that you won't get sick,

896
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,480
but you'll get sick much less

897
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,420
and it won't create severe illness.

898
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,417
- Now, one thing that's gonna come up,

899
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:49,910
and this comes up a lot again,

900
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,700
in the catastrophization camp,

901
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,300
but what about the long
haulers and the terrible damage

902
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,160
to the lungs and the cardiac damage

903
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,610
and the brain damage

904
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,120
and all the other things.

905
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,980
- You know, those happened with influenza.

906
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,813
- [Dr. Z] Exactly, right.

907
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:05,000
- So my son, my young son, 13 year old now

908
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,600
a couple years ago, got the flu

909
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,945
and he'd had the flu vaccine

910
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:10,140
and he still got the flu.

911
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,973
- Which happens.

912
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,990
- Yeah, it happens I mean it was fine.

913
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,250
Like, it was a little worse
than I thought it would

914
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,380
when you normally would get,

915
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,860
and he was getting better

916
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,100
and he woke up one morning

917
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,010
and he couldn't walk.

918
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,060
- [Dr. Z] Oh my gosh.

919
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,090
- I was going through all the panic things

920
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,943
when you go through medical
school, you always have to.

921
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:29,336
- Like Guillain-Barre.
- That's exactly

922
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:30,780
- Transverse myelitis.

923
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,390
- And I'm like, Oh God.

924
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,250
So it turned out it was benign myositis.

925
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,190
Thank God and within a
week he was walking again.

926
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,470
Flu has all kinds of strange side effects.

927
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,930
It has neurologic side effects.

928
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,280
It can have cardiac side effects.

929
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,488
We put these in context, right?

930
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:49,210
These are things that happen.

931
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,980
Absolutely can happen.

932
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,500
but we have a lot of information

933
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,770
about how frequent they are.

934
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,940
Are they likely?

935
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,101
How long lasting they are?

936
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,120
If it was Guillain-Barre
would have been terrible,

937
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,370
but if it's benign myositis it'd last week

938
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,410
and he's okay.

939
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,070
- So that's funny because my
daughter had a viral syndrome

940
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,410
when she was three and couldn't walk

941
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,008
and again benign myositis.

942
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:11,523
But again, you go through the panic,

943
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:14,900
but the point being these things happen

944
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,860
with viral infection,

945
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,593
this is a new viral infection

946
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:20,620
that we don't have a vaccine for.

947
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,600
That is novel to the
degree that it's novel.

948
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,340
Although we seem to have
some innate immunity

949
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,410
from cross-reactivity to Corona Virus,

950
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:32,230
and yet we are spinning it
as if the world is ending.

951
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,150
And the thing is that would be fine

952
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,720
if we thought it was actually
going to cause less harm

953
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,190
to spin it that way than not,

954
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,780
but it's actually causing a lot of harm

955
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,300
in terms of the response.

956
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,220
So whether it's suicide rate going up,

957
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,438
substance abuse, economic catastrophe,

958
00:33:48,438 --> 00:33:50,450
mortgaging our children's future,

959
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,810
creating intergenerational divides now.

960
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,350
- Yeah, I was hoping we
get to talk about that.

961
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,320
'Cause that's something

962
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,490
I think has been vastly underemphasized

963
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,310
and it's breaking my heart.

964
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,710
So let's talk about suicide.

965
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,871
The CDC released a report, I think in July

966
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:09,871
that it was a report where they
ask about suicidal ideation.

967
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,279
Like how many suicidal thoughts,

968
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,500
have you have you had any
serious suicidal thoughts.

969
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,480
One in four 18 to 24 year olds,

970
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,520
one in four 18 to 24 year olds in June

971
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,073
had serious thoughts of suicide.

972
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,360
- You know, so my assistant
is in her early twenties

973
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,100
and she only just recently told me

974
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,860
during the early lockdown stuff,

975
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,500
we didn't have her in our house.

976
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,070
And, kind of kept her on a, not a furlough

977
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,330
we were paying her, but she isolated.

978
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,909
Now this is a hyper social
person in the prime of her life

979
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,489
who is now told, don't leave your house

980
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:48,149
sit there with your dog.

981
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,620
And she told me now that it
was so awful for her, you know?

982
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,949
- Yeah, for a disease for
her 20 early twenties,

983
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,685
probably one in 10,000 death rate.

984
00:34:56,686 --> 00:35:01,640
We're basically imposing
asking young people

985
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,490
who are meant to live in community.

986
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,910
Not me I was a hermit,

987
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,433
but everyone,
- Me too, I really enjoy this.

988
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:12,433
- But we're not meant to live
alone in our house hold up,

989
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:15,280
it's going to have consequences.

990
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,830
It's gonna have severe
negative consequences,

991
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,723
psychologically, and we
are already seeing it.

992
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,723
That is just the beginning
of the cost of the lockdown.

993
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,690
Worldwide, they're reports
of hundreds, of millions,

994
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,880
of additional people starving as a result

995
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,550
because you said you're
talking about economics.

996
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,980
So one of the themes I've
heard argued against me

997
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,813
when I make this point

998
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:42,568
is, well, look, you're
talking about the lockdowns

999
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:44,270
and there's some economic costs,

1000
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,210
but what are they relative
to the lives we save.

1001
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,060
But it's not lives on one
side the economy on the other.

1002
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:55,060
The economy is really important
to the lives of the people

1003
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,343
who are in the midst of it.

1004
00:35:56,343 --> 00:35:59,860
And hundreds of millions
of people around the world

1005
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,723
that are on the edge of economic disaster.

1006
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,510
And you push them over you,

1007
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,960
you destroy the world economy.

1008
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,260
It's not just dollars.

1009
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,010
It's hundreds of millions
of people starving.

1010
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,173
And that's what the UN has said.

1011
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:13,430
Then you go, and it's fine.

1012
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,210
- I said this, like in the
first month of this pandemic,

1013
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,010
I said, you guys seem to
have this false dichotomy

1014
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,260
between economy and lives.

1015
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Blood is treasure it's there
it's a transitive property.

1016
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,740
When you start having unemployment,

1017
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,290
the suicide rate goes up

1018
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,930
in the world when you
shut the economy down,

1019
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,580
people starved to death.

1020
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,161
And this idea,

1021
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,510
and I'm gonna rant for one second

1022
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,030
and you may or may not agree with me.

1023
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,160
I feel like my own tribe of people,

1024
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,260
the healthcare professionals,

1025
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,515
have held the rest of our country hostage

1026
00:36:46,515 --> 00:36:48,860
with their catastrophizing around this,

1027
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,410
which was done with good intent.

1028
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,620
These are good smart people.

1029
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,453
And they're right.

1030
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:54,680
We've had deaths and terrible outcomes,

1031
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,020
but they fail to see the bigger picture.

1032
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,140
And Monica Gandhi on
the show yesterday said,

1033
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,420
as doctors it's our
responsibility to see this.

1034
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,288
- Our job is to show people that picture,

1035
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,243
I'd say even more than just,

1036
00:37:05,243 --> 00:37:08,670
I mean, I call us the
Zoomocracy and I mean it.

1037
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,270
So like, I'm fine

1038
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,170
I can be on Zoom and
I'm not going to lose my

1039
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,290
well, maybe who knows the
Sanford could keep me.

1040
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,496
- We gotta talk about that.

1041
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:18,810
- But I think I'm fine, right?

1042
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,680
So like, why should I care about,

1043
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,640
well, my job is to tell people

1044
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,153
what's happening in the
rest of the world, I think.

1045
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,150
There's this program called Gavi,

1046
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,015
which is a program for vaccinations

1047
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,540
International Program for Vaccinations.

1048
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,730
They've halted their operations
because of the lockdown.

1049
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,070
- So polio comes back,

1050
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,910
measles comes back.

1051
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,680
measles never gone, measles is still here.

1052
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,530
- Yeah we're gonna see research

1053
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,780
we may even see resurgents
in polio in the United States

1054
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,437
because people stopped taking their kids

1055
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,880
for the Tdap vaccine.

1056
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,230
- Yeah absolutely cancer screening,

1057
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,330
their mental--

1058
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,970
- So we've had good news from
cancer for the past few years.

1059
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,190
We've actually had decreases
in cancer related mortality

1060
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,750
for the first time in my memory anyways,

1061
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,110
for three or four years in a row

1062
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,020
that will reverse,

1063
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,880
we're gonna start seeing
later stage breast cancers,

1064
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,270
later stage prostate cancers,

1065
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,960
people stopped getting screening.

1066
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,580
People actually even
stopped getting treatment

1067
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,316
for cancer, active cancer.

1068
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:15,110
During the epidemic.
- Yeah I've seen that.

1069
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:19,420
HIV, patients are losing
their viral suppression.

1070
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,840
Monica was talking about that

1071
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,760
because they're not coming in.

1072
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,170
- Tuberculosis millions of
extra tuberculosis cases

1073
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,003
'cause you have tuberculosis,

1074
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,678
you have to treat over
a long period of time

1075
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,650
with regular antibiotics.

1076
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,540
People come in around the world

1077
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,373
because they're--

1078
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:32,870
- Directly observed therapy,
all this other stuff.

1079
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,968
- Exactly and that stopped

1080
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:37,510
were gonna see a resurgence
of tuberculosis deaths.

1081
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,343
- Well, so let me ask a question

1082
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:40,940
because this is very gloomy stuff.

1083
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,300
Like, honestly, when you said earlier,

1084
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,660
you were heartbroken.

1085
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,820
This is what keeps me up at night

1086
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,230
because you know here
we have this platform

1087
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,063
we can get to see,

1088
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:51,230
like you said, we're
part of the Zoomocracy.

1089
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,090
Like we can do this,

1090
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,740
we can get this information out,

1091
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,120
but it doesn't sink in.

1092
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,690
And what it does is, I worry
that it even contributes more

1093
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,590
to this polarization

1094
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,480
because there are camps

1095
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,617
that get so emotional

1096
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:04,550
about the damage we've
done from our response

1097
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,350
and camps that gets so emotional

1098
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,440
from The United States' perceived failure

1099
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,560
relative to other countries

1100
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,330
in terms of mortality per million.

1101
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,320
- I'm heartbroken at both.

1102
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,280
I mean, I think we in public
health need to balance

1103
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,223
COVID is not the only
threat to public health.

1104
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,780
We need to understand

1105
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,950
that there's all kinds of
public health problems.

1106
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,670
- So what do you think you would say

1107
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,100
The United States should do?

1108
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,933
And then I wanna talk

1109
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:33,170
about Sweden and Europe and Asia too,

1110
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,780
but what do you think the
United States should do?

1111
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,800
So here's the problem,

1112
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,190
all this disaster from our response

1113
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,530
and then the danger of the virus,

1114
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,320
which is worse for the elders
and people with comorbidities.

1115
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,810
And it's blessed than
we thought initially.

1116
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,300
And we have a little better treatment now.

1117
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,700
So what do you think?

1118
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,560
- If I had to characterize
the American response.

1119
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,860
It's exactly backwards.

1120
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,693
- [Dr. Z] Yes.

1121
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:53,720
- We have quarantined the healthy

1122
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,453
and we've exposed the
vulnerable to the disease.

1123
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,220
- That's it and Monica said yesterday.

1124
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,170
- [Dr. Jay] Flip that around.

1125
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,750
- Monica said yesterday, we
were exactly backwards as well.

1126
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,160
We've favored the rich
people who can survive this,

1127
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,570
the Zoomocracy like you and I,

1128
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,470
and we've punished the poor.

1129
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,700
So we've actually told them,
stay inside, lose your jobs,

1130
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,800
get $1,200 a month.

1131
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,050
- Yeah, or you go out and expose yourself,

1132
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,900
deliver the groceries to
- Essential worker.

1133
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,730
- Yeah, I don't understand it.

1134
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,490
I could understand three in a 100 deaths.

1135
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,399
- Different story

1136
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,467
- You imagine it,

1137
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:34,324
but even there you'd wanna focus response

1138
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:36,750
and figure out who really is

1139
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,583
- In that 3%.

1140
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,877
- Right, exactly and there may be people

1141
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:40,578
who are less vulnerable.

1142
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:43,521
You tailor your strategy around
the numbers you're seeing,

1143
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:44,865
but we haven't done that yet.

1144
00:40:44,865 --> 00:40:46,990
We've gone the opposite
route since in many ways,

1145
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,015
I think New York is an absolute disaster,

1146
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:50,742
New York, I mean,

1147
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,620
the highest death rates in the world

1148
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,023
happened in the Northeast
early map of the United States.

1149
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:58,820
- Yeah and multiple
reasons for that probably

1150
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,340
that will become clear
also more in retrospect

1151
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,660
and our retrospectoscope

1152
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,660
is is gonna be highly, highly indicting.

1153
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,410
I think of a lot of behavior
that we had early on.

1154
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,560
- Yeah, can we return to,
you were asking me earlier

1155
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,860
about like the scientific
discussion around this.

1156
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,610
- Yeah, I would love to,

1157
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,090
- So I've been really concerned
about censorship in science

1158
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,100
around this epidemic.

1159
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,933
- As have I.

1160
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:25,990
- Yeah and so like you mentioned,

1161
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,554
John Ioannidis is one of the foremost
physicians in the world,

1162
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,230
researchers in the world studying.

1163
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,060
I had the honor to be
able to work with him.

1164
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,460
He did an interview
early on in the epidemic

1165
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,533
that was suppressed by YouTube.

1166
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,628
- How do you suppress John Ioannidis?

1167
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,830
- I don't know, I don't understand it.

1168
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,691
My view of science is
that it's a conversation.

1169
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:52,159
We have to have the ability

1170
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,030
to express views that are not popular

1171
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,100
or else we can't have a science.

1172
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,126
We can't have science.

1173
00:41:58,126 --> 00:41:59,970
- I mean.

1174
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,160
- So the idea

1175
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,350
is that somehow if somebody
is expressing a view

1176
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,524
that is contrary to
somebody's interpretation

1177
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:11,000
of some public health organization,

1178
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,450
World Health Organization or whatever,

1179
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,680
it's ipso facto dangerous
to say those views,

1180
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,991
that is a form of population control.

1181
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:18,824
That's what it is, right.

1182
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:20,000
- It really is, yeah.

1183
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
- It's fine if you know,

1184
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,950
with 100% scientific certainty,

1185
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,240
that some fact--

1186
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,073
- Is wrong.

1187
00:42:28,073 --> 00:42:28,906
- Yes.

1188
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:30,522
- Yeah, like vaccines cause autism, right?

1189
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:31,391
- So what's the your response.

1190
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:34,190
You say, look, the vaccines
don't cause autism, right?

1191
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,054
That's the right response.

1192
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:35,887
- [Dr. Z] That's right.

1193
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,947
- And here's the evidence.
- [Dr. Z] That's right.

1194
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:41,730
- If you have a situation of a new virus

1195
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,030
where the science is emerging rapidly

1196
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,130
and we're learning new things,

1197
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,590
I've changed my mind about 15 things

1198
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,510
about this virus

1199
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,980
as I've read new papers
- [Dr. Z] Me too.

1200
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,813
- over the course,

1201
00:42:49,813 --> 00:42:50,646
how could you not?

1202
00:42:50,646 --> 00:42:53,540
- Yeah but you know what, read
the comments in my videos.

1203
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,148
You flip-flopped on this five times.

1204
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:57,422
- Got me with this new
evidence coming up right.

1205
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:58,255
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

1206
00:42:58,255 --> 00:42:59,445
- So in that context,

1207
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:01,770
scientific censorship is criminal.

1208
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,740
- Yeah. I agree.

1209
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,903
- And so I think,

1210
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,340
and we've seen this over and over again,

1211
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,410
there's a set of papers

1212
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,990
by this scientist, Gabriella Gomez

1213
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,600
on the Herd Immunity threshold.

1214
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,690
- [Dr. Z] I love her work, yeah.

1215
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,580
- And what I've seen her write
is that she sent her paper

1216
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,810
to scientific journals

1217
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,680
the editors won't even
send it out for review

1218
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,484
because they're saying
that it's too dangerous

1219
00:43:25,484 --> 00:43:28,439
her findings suggest a lower
Herd Immunity threshold.

1220
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,600
Now I don't know if it's
right or wrong, I don't--

1221
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,570
- Does it matter?

1222
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,807
- Well, let's just have a
scientific conversation about it.

1223
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:37,080
Why is that so dangerous to talk about

1224
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,090
that you wouldn't even
send it out for review?

1225
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,980
- I mean, the last time
we did stuff like this,

1226
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,065
it was the inquisition in Galileo.

1227
00:43:43,065 --> 00:43:44,510
- I felt a little like that Stanford.

1228
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,562
I think the,
- Tell me about it

1229
00:43:46,562 --> 00:43:47,721
- well, we'll talk about
that in just a bit.

1230
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:51,550
But I think the knee jerk reaction

1231
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,924
to censor people that you disagree with

1232
00:43:52,924 --> 00:43:54,700
inside the scientific community

1233
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,350
has been absolutely terrible.

1234
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,740
One of my Stanford colleagues

1235
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,410
actually wrote a New York Times article

1236
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,710
arguing for essentially a censorship board

1237
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,953
for our articles in Nova Science.

1238
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,610
- Hey, look, I kind of am an expert

1239
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,210
in misinformation management.

1240
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,540
I have always, look, remember
those Bakersfield Docs,

1241
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,400
they were proposing some similar ideas

1242
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,233
to what you were saying,

1243
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:18,710
but their, their data was
a little and you know,

1244
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,620
they were clearly a little.

1245
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,453
- I've talked to them,

1246
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:21,860
look, there's stuff I agree with it,

1247
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,350
but there's stuff, I don't
necessarily agree with them,

1248
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,120
but why should they not be
part of the conversation?

1249
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,030
- Exactly, so when that video came out,

1250
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,010
a million people sent it to
me, what do you think of this?

1251
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,030
And I said, well, let me
do a show on what I think.

1252
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,800
I agree with them that
lockdowns are harmful.

1253
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,530
I agree with them we're
overreacting creating fear.

1254
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:36,720
I disagree with their use of the data

1255
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,928
on this and this and this.

1256
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:41,230
And I disagree that
YouTube pulled their clip.

1257
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,430
- Yeah it's ridiculous.

1258
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,820
- Why would you do that?

1259
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,330
All you're gonna do is
also solidify this idea

1260
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,560
that there's a conspiracy.

1261
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,202
- I think the idea that media
organizations or Stanford

1262
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:55,840
has some obligation to
censor opposing views

1263
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,010
is absolutely anathema to science.

1264
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:03,010
- And you know, my wife is
on a Listserv at Stanford.

1265
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,100
So a bunch of people
that I know at Stanford

1266
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,700
got on a Listserv on the
Stanford listserv email

1267
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,990
and said, "we hear by
disavow Scott Atlas."

1268
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:11,860
- Oh, that's disgusting.

1269
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,687
- Yeah so can you tell
me a little about that?

1270
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:17,130
- Sure, so again one of my
colleagues sign that letter too.

1271
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:17,963
You know people I respect.

1272
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:19,873
- [Dr. Z] People I respect
to know are on that.

1273
00:45:19,873 --> 00:45:20,706
- People I love are on that list.

1274
00:45:20,706 --> 00:45:21,939
I mean like friends,

1275
00:45:21,939 --> 00:45:23,670
I mean, I disagree with them

1276
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,503
about some of the things.

1277
00:45:24,503 --> 00:45:25,970
- Right, but we can
love people and disagree

1278
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,710
without shutting them up.

1279
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,651
- So think Dr. Atlas Scott

1280
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:35,330
is the Special Advisor to
the President on COVID.

1281
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,620
He has certain views

1282
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,870
about the nature of the epidemic.

1283
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,623
They're actually closer to
my views than by colleagues.

1284
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,980
So among those views

1285
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,980
are things like the disease
is less dangerous for kids,

1286
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,410
less dangerous than the flu for kids.

1287
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,340
That seems like there's
solid scientific evidence.

1288
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,920
And yet the letter it seems
to like paint this picture

1289
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,560
about the danger to kids.

1290
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,963
I think my colleagues
are just wrong on this.

1291
00:45:59,963 --> 00:46:01,573
The way they disagree with Scott on this,

1292
00:46:01,573 --> 00:46:02,900
- I agree when I read the letter,

1293
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,060
I'm like, these guys are just wrong.

1294
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,130
They haven't read what Scott is saying.

1295
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,880
Now, look, I don't agree
with Scott on everything.

1296
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,460
- So now I think they've
also mischaracterized

1297
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,790
what Scott has said.

1298
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,350
So for instance, Scott has repeatedly said

1299
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,670
that he's not in favor of
a Herd Immunity strategy.

1300
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,114
Actually, we should talk a
little bit about Herd Immunity

1301
00:46:16,114 --> 00:46:16,970
- Herd Immunity Strategy.

1302
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,500
- What does that actually mean?

1303
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,952
Herd Immunity means that,

1304
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:23,190
so when we think about Herd Immunity,

1305
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,680
if we think about it as a single number,

1306
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,430
but it's again, just
like infection fatality

1307
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,821
is not a single number.

1308
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:29,240
What Herd Immunity means

1309
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,520
is that when a new
person gets the disease,

1310
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,330
how many people are
they gonna spread it to?

1311
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,053
If it's less than one, then
you reached Herd Immunity.

1312
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:37,963
- It's gonna be squashed.

1313
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:39,620
- Exactly, if there's more than one,

1314
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,940
then you get more sort of
this exponential growth right.

1315
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,773
- [Dr. Z] Right.

1316
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,267
- That happens with every disease

1317
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:46,920
where immunity actually happens,

1318
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,133
that's just normal.

1319
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:53,970
The number is a function of
how people interact in society.

1320
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,597
So if I interact with a lot of people

1321
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,063
and I get it, I will spread it.

1322
00:46:57,063 --> 00:47:00,127
If I'm sort of more
fearful about the disease

1323
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:01,213
and I spreading it,

1324
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:04,210
then then social distancing happens

1325
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,110
then Herd Immunity, could get
lower to meet the thresholds.

1326
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:09,100
'Cause one person getting it,

1327
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,440
doesn't spread to a lot of people.

1328
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,696
So it's a function of
the behavior of people,

1329
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,480
as well as again, the virus itself,

1330
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,313
it's not a single number

1331
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,590
where you say, okay,
here's, we've reached it.

1332
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,390
And ironically, you can reach it

1333
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,330
cases are declining

1334
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,280
and people stop taking those precautions.

1335
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,430
and it goes back up again.

1336
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,030
We can go in and out of Herd Immunity.

1337
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,130
- Right, autoregulation homeostasis

1338
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,240
of the population's behavior.

1339
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,072
- Yeah, exactly so that's actually,

1340
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:32,993
it's more complicated than that.

1341
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,250
Personally Scott has told me,

1342
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,556
I've never told the president

1343
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:40,480
that he's in favor of
Herd Immunity strategy.

1344
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,313
He is not.

1345
00:47:41,313 --> 00:47:43,443
He specifically said that the
letter my colleagues wrote

1346
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,210
accused him of that, just falsely.

1347
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,210
It's just, if you set up the straw, man,

1348
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,180
I mean, I just, I don't understand it.

1349
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,830
It's like they weren't listening

1350
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,240
and partly it's the press's fault.

1351
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,180
Like the press has
mischaracterized him as well.

1352
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,620
- For sure, this is what I think happened.

1353
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,210
And honestly, and you can correct me.

1354
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,360
They read the press,
they read some CNN, MSNBC

1355
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,700
Scott, Atlas doesn't knows
nothing about science.

1356
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,630
And he's got president's ear.

1357
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,183
- He was the Chair of Neuroradiology
at Stanford for years.

1358
00:48:10,183 --> 00:48:12,260
I mean, I just don't,

1359
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,250
- My wife worked with him right.

1360
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,940
And the thing is, if you hear him talk

1361
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,320
again, he's reiterating some
of the concerns that we have.

1362
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,360
He's never said,

1363
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,940
let it rip through the
population and develop.

1364
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,940
- That's that's the
exact opposite strategy.

1365
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,610
I know he's been telling the president.

1366
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,330
- Right, right and the thing
is, you've talked to him,

1367
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:32,580
have these colleagues talk to him, no.

1368
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,610
And this is what happens.

1369
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,970
You have in-group.

1370
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,020
This is his tribe of people.

1371
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,970
Now excommunicating him

1372
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,580
and which hunting him

1373
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,250
because that's what's
happening on social media.

1374
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,780
That's what's happening
in the halls of academia.

1375
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,000
Is this how you met him?

1376
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,290
Okay just play with this for a second.

1377
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:54,643
What if your right and Neeraj is right.

1378
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:57,180
And in retrospect we realize

1379
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,400
you guys were actually
banging the right drum

1380
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,940
and these people who
censored, you were wrong.

1381
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:06,010
Okay, that is gonna be a
criminal act that they did.

1382
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:06,950
That costs lives.

1383
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,733
- Yeah, I think there was an
attempt to cancel me right.

1384
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:09,893
- [Dr. Z] Oh, for sure.

1385
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,480
- I don't actually care I get canceled.

1386
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,256
What I really want is the
data to drive the policy.

1387
00:49:17,256 --> 00:49:18,880
That's what I really want.

1388
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,150
And I think Scott would
say the same thing.

1389
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,720
I mean, it's just not personal for him.

1390
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,790
It's like, let's let the
data drive the policy.

1391
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,150
Cause the cost on lies are high

1392
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,610
on both sides of this decision.

1393
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,820
There's no riskless option here.

1394
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,653
- [Dr. Z] Right.

1395
00:49:31,653 --> 00:49:34,240
- So whether you lock
down or don't lock down

1396
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,530
is not a, okay, let's
just stay safe on one side

1397
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,380
so my colleagues started the letter

1398
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,250
with the principle of do no harm.

1399
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,250
How do you do no harm in this situation?

1400
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,960
- There's plenty of ways to
do harm sensor a colleague.

1401
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,830
- [Dr. Jay] For instance.

1402
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,650
- On insufficient information.

1403
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,740
Now, I imagine,

1404
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,450
okay, so let's dig into
that a little more,

1405
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,400
and you can refuse to
answer this if you like.

1406
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,850
Your own paper was attacked internally

1407
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,450
in a almost politicized way.

1408
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,850
It wasn't so much about the science.

1409
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,120
And I was reading these things

1410
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,034
about the internecine
drama at Stanford.

1411
00:50:08,034 --> 00:50:10,803
And I'm like, I know these
people, what are they doing?

1412
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,190
- It was absolutely shocking to me.

1413
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,260
I feel like my academic
freedom was attacked

1414
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:20,150
and I've been at the university
for 30 plus years actually

1415
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:22,340
the motto of the university

1416
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,440
is "Let The Winds of Freedom Blow."

1417
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't think that they acted,

1418
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,780
the leaders of the university
have acted in that way

1419
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,510
toward my study.

1420
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,600
And it's been absolutely shocking to me.

1421
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,560
- Are you tenured?

1422
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,393
- I am.

1423
00:50:33,393 --> 00:50:34,280
- Okay, so you can say this kind of thing.

1424
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,090
- Well, I don't care if I lose my job.

1425
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,590
- You know what I'll hire you.

1426
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,067
We could be like ,

1427
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:42,630
you know, we could have one
of these like Sunday mornings

1428
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:43,850
- It's been really
enjoyable talking to you

1429
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,454
- Bhattacharya that would be really fun.

1430
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:50,454
So to this thing, I was shocked when I saw

1431
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,210
how this thing was played out.

1432
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,420
And I knew that what
the press was reporting,

1433
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,100
wasn't the full story.

1434
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:57,933
It was still concerning.

1435
00:50:57,933 --> 00:50:59,251
I was like, well, is
there a lot of bias here

1436
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:00,880
is this thing, you know?

1437
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,340
And so I was waiting to
talk to you about this.

1438
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,443
And you know, at some point
I'll have one of the colleagues

1439
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,170
that's attacking you guys on the show

1440
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,010
and see what they think.

1441
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,181
'Cause it'd be interesting, right.

1442
00:51:10,181 --> 00:51:11,014
- [Dr. Jay] Yeah.

1443
00:51:11,014 --> 00:51:12,530
- But I would love to see that play out

1444
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,799
in a way that isn't just politicized.

1445
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:14,960
Cause it's this.

1446
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,790
- Yeah I got to do a
debate with Stan Vermund.

1447
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,080
- Oh yeah I know Stan.

1448
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,920
I know of Stan.

1449
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,590
- Yeah, so it was really interesting.

1450
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,912
Like he's a Yale,

1451
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:29,890
the Head of the Public
Health Department at Yale.

1452
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,723
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

1453
00:51:30,723 --> 00:51:31,556
- Really sweet guy.

1454
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:32,893
- Talked really slow

1455
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:35,210
I was listening to
debate going , oh my God

1456
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,180
I got to put it up to three X.

1457
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,466
Except when you talk, then
I had to slow it down.

1458
00:51:39,466 --> 00:51:40,520
- [Dr. Jay] I'm sorry.

1459
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,431
- No, no I love fast talkers.

1460
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:45,190
- I bet but I think is that he's open.

1461
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,023
He wants to talk.

1462
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:46,970
He wants to have a conversation.

1463
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,640
I wish we had that spirit of Stanford.

1464
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,080
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

1465
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,880
- I think in some ways we have lost that

1466
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,030
and it's been dispiriting for me.

1467
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,010
- Yeah. I agree.

1468
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:56,890
Well, you know, the two folks

1469
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,653
that I interviewed from
UCSF, Monica and Vinay

1470
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:02,920
are deeply embodied that spirit

1471
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,220
of open discourse.

1472
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,680
They may politically disagree.

1473
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,650
It doesn't matter.

1474
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:09,770
They only wanna have the conversation

1475
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,880
in a polite and civil way.

1476
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,553
- Yeah, I mean, I that's the thing,

1477
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,483
Internally I don't think,

1478
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,230
I don't know what joining
these politics are.

1479
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:22,670
I have literally no idea.

1480
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,973
I don't and I'm pretty sure
if I were to talk with Eran

1481
00:52:25,973 --> 00:52:27,762
that we would disagree about politics.

1482
00:52:27,762 --> 00:52:30,000
It doesn't matter, we're doing science,

1483
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,833
- [Dr. Z] Right.

1484
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,910
- Like we move to what the data tell us.

1485
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,540
- Eran Bendavid who was also a resident

1486
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,390
when I was an attending there.

1487
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,980
I'm gonna try to have
him on the show later.

1488
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,053
- Yeah he was the lead author
on the Santa Clara Study.

1489
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:42,160
- Yeah so I can dig in a
little more with him, yeah.

1490
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,030
It's great to be next to all
these smart people, you know.

1491
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,910
But so it's been just a mess.

1492
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,990
It's been hard I imagine.

1493
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,030
Forget, it's been hard on you
clearly, you and your family,

1494
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,720
but secondary thing that has been hard

1495
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,480
on our scientific advancement

1496
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,060
and understanding this virus

1497
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,120
because when you suppress these ideas,

1498
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:00,953
what happens?

1499
00:53:00,953 --> 00:53:04,381
They pop up on Twitter
in a weaponized form.

1500
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,090
So now you have frank anti maskers

1501
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:09,940
that are taking masks and
ripping out the lining

1502
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,970
so that they can do the hygiene theater

1503
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,890
without the actual filter.

1504
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,470
You know, I mean this crazy stuff,

1505
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:16,370
none of that would have happened

1506
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,960
if we'd just been open and honest.

1507
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,600
- Yeah, I think it's the same thing

1508
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,660
with the anti-vaxxers right.

1509
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,367
So like
- [Dr. Z] Same thing.

1510
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,640
- Actually, the funny thing is like

1511
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,400
we should talk about the vaccines.

1512
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,950
- Let's just say that, yeah.

1513
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,180
- But I think if a vaccine does
come out and it's effective.

1514
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,756
The fact that the scientific
community is acting this way

1515
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:37,810
will create doubt around the vaccine.

1516
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:38,643
- Who's gonna get it?

1517
00:53:38,643 --> 00:53:40,250
40% of Americans don't want to get it now.

1518
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,799
- Yeah and because the
scientific community

1519
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:46,020
is very, very clearly seems
politicized around this.

1520
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,810
- 1000% and remember in
the early days of fear,

1521
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,690
when we were in the Imperial
college sphere of influence,

1522
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,480
and we thought 3 million
Americans were gonna die,

1523
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,400
there was not an anti-vaxx
voice to be heard.

1524
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,830
They were terrified.

1525
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,290
They wouldn't open their mouth.

1526
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:04,440
They saw, oh, 'cause
when push comes to shove,

1527
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,680
if there's a vaccine,

1528
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,270
they're gonna be first in line to get it

1529
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,279
when you're afraid for your life.

1530
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,220
But then as this thing spun out now,

1531
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,090
they've actually been empowered in a way

1532
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,690
that we haven't remembered in recent.

1533
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:17,260
- It's because the scientific
community is screwed up.

1534
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,671
- [Dr. Z] They've made
idiots of themselves.

1535
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:19,770
- Yeah.

1536
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,120
- Does it make you want to
hit stuff and throw stuff.

1537
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,720
'cause I get emotional about it.

1538
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:25,881
- I'm not built that way.

1539
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,200
- I forget sometimes

1540
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,750
that I'm talking to scientific introverts

1541
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,070
who have like spock like controls,

1542
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,080
whereas I'm the opposite.

1543
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,740
I'm just like throw the table
over and kill everybody.

1544
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,893
- Well, when, when they
were talking to my wife,

1545
00:54:37,893 --> 00:54:39,545
you know that means--

1546
00:54:39,545 --> 00:54:40,397
- [Dr. Z] That's too much.

1547
00:54:40,397 --> 00:54:43,840
- But other than that I
still just want to know

1548
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,930
what the right thing to do is.

1549
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:49,930
- Right, there've been things
where I've gone back and forth

1550
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,647
because I'm not convinced
one way or the other.

1551
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,690
And I will literally sit up at night

1552
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,530
going I put out a video today saying this

1553
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:01,107
and is it really a 100% right?

1554
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:03,050
No, it can't be a 100% right

1555
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,250
'cause we don't know yet.

1556
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,524
So am I doing more harm
than good saying it,

1557
00:55:06,524 --> 00:55:08,190
what's the harm reduction.

1558
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,320
- You have to say what
you currently believe.

1559
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,806
And then when you find new
evidence you change your mind

1560
00:55:12,806 --> 00:55:14,116
you say it.

1561
00:55:14,116 --> 00:55:15,810
- That's the thing.

1562
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,530
So that's what it is.

1563
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,950
But, but it's hard.

1564
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,360
For me it's emotionally difficult

1565
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:25,060
because I tend to
involute this emotionally.

1566
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,160
Whereas again, that's
why I'm not a researcher.

1567
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,000
So a researcher I could have
a little more equanimity.

1568
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,890
- I mean,
- [Dr. Z] It's meditation,

1569
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,350
- it's hard to admit
that you're wrong right.

1570
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,253
That's just, but look, you
can't do science without that,

1571
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,680
'cause new data come out
and you change your mind.

1572
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,803
- So let me ask you a
question, speaking of data.

1573
00:55:41,803 --> 00:55:44,145
So, and I've been meaning
to ask this of you.

1574
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:46,700
So you read an Atlantic
article, all right.

1575
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,640
And it says, here's all
the cognitive distortions

1576
00:55:53,326 --> 00:55:55,550
that we've shown in this thing.

1577
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,340
And it was the actually
the opposite version

1578
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,220
of what I've been saying,

1579
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,700
which is here are the
cognitive distortions

1580
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,630
that we've are showing

1581
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,000
that cause us to catastrophize
and misunderstand

1582
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,833
the science on this.

1583
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,520
They were saying, well,
here's all the reasons

1584
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,610
that America screwed it up

1585
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,177
and not taking it seriously and so on.

1586
00:56:08,177 --> 00:56:09,847
And we have this terrible mortality rate

1587
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:11,600
and the high case rate and all that.

1588
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,980
And they would say things in
there just throw away things

1589
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,990
like, and then they're Sweden's policy,

1590
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,970
which is folly and they put a link

1591
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,070
and they wished they hadn't done.

1592
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,130
How do you respond to that?

1593
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,870
- I mean, U.S has higher death
rate than Sweden right now.

1594
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:24,730
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

1595
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:28,083
- More cases per million in
the United States than Sweden.

1596
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,100
To characterize Sweden as a failure

1597
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,120
seems like, I mean they've made mistakes.

1598
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,120
It's in the early days, I think

1599
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,780
- Not protecting the elderly.

1600
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,780
- Yeah, they wait until early April

1601
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,380
to essentially protect the
nursing homes in a serious way.

1602
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,300
And I think that led to
some of their higher deaths,

1603
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,457
but that's the same way
U.S made the same mistake.

1604
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:45,610
- We did the same thing.

1605
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,967
45% of deaths were nursing home patients

1606
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:49,325
0.6% of the population.

1607
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:54,325
So Sweden actually took a
very different approach.

1608
00:56:54,988 --> 00:56:58,610
- I think it's more consistent
with what a democracy does

1609
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,250
in the context of these
kinds of things, right?

1610
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,153
So the idea of the
lockdown we were copying,

1611
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,760
what Japan, oh, sorry not
Japan, what China did.

1612
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,593
- Right.

1613
00:57:07,593 --> 00:57:08,426
- I like this idea

1614
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:12,410
but the idea that we could
do this militarized lockdown,

1615
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:15,520
I don't think is consistent
with a constitutional democracy.

1616
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,353
- [Dr. Z] I agree.

1617
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:17,780
- And you're seeing this play out

1618
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,780
in places like Australia or Victoria,

1619
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,930
where they have essentially
a very draconian lockdown.

1620
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,530
You can only go out for an hour.

1621
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,660
If you're gonna go to a
park, you have to walk alone.

1622
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,640
You know, I don't think that's consistent.

1623
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,694
I mean, people will play
with that for a while

1624
00:57:34,694 --> 00:57:36,750
if it's a 3% mortality rate.

1625
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,583
- [Dr. Z] Sure.

1626
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,060
- But they won't put up with it forever.

1627
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:44,050
And that's a constraint on
public health in a democracy.

1628
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,560
You have to take that into account.

1629
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,400
You can't pretend

1630
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,450
like, oh, it's really unfortunate

1631
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:50,060
that people won't put
up with this forever.

1632
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:54,130
- I said that in February.

1633
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,370
I said, what we're seeing in Wuhan

1634
00:57:55,370 --> 00:58:00,050
is absolutely never going to
be feasible in this democracy.

1635
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,470
It's just not.

1636
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,306
And you could just say,
well, then people will die

1637
00:58:03,306 --> 00:58:04,370
because of that.

1638
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,750
Then that's the cost of living
in a constitutional democracy

1639
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,780
that you will not have
that kind of control.

1640
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,100
And one thing I would say to that

1641
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,600
is life is to be lived

1642
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,430
we don't live in fear of
death or dismemberment

1643
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:19,390
every single second we're awake.

1644
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,160
And that's an ethos that I
think is worth supporting.

1645
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,920
And again, that's a
personal thing I mandatory.

1646
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,650
- Yeah, but I think
that's completely right.

1647
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:30,130
I think one of the unfortunate
outcomes of this pandemic

1648
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,190
has been to train people,

1649
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,510
to think of other human beings

1650
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,730
as just bags of germs to be avoided.

1651
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:36,577
- You're right.

1652
00:58:36,577 --> 00:58:38,519
- It's going to take a long time

1653
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:40,060
to repair the damage from that

1654
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,130
- It's a social dissolution.

1655
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,300
And then what happens now

1656
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,180
we have, you know, unrest
on a massive level.

1657
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,230
I'm not saying they're
directly correlated,

1658
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,380
but I'm saying they're
directly correlated.

1659
00:58:54,777 --> 00:58:55,610
- It wouldn't surprise me.

1660
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:59,070
I think that people are
psychologically frayed.

1661
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,418
- Yeah, I am.

1662
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:02,812
Monica, when she came yesterday,

1663
00:59:02,812 --> 00:59:04,530
like I said, you don't know me.

1664
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:06,630
The reason she came

1665
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,200
was she wanted to talk to
another human being face to face

1666
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,540
about things she cares about.

1667
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,600
And she has been able to do that.

1668
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,710
Zoom is, listen, Zoom is great
from a technological level,

1669
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,540
what a wonderful tool, right.

1670
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,230
I hate it, it makes me wanna die.

1671
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:20,780
And the reason is I'm an extrovert

1672
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,790
and being in the room with someone,

1673
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,870
like you and I right now

1674
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,760
could not have the same conversation.

1675
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,860
I'm reading your body
language in real time.

1676
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,000
It's a 2000 frame per second refresh rate.

1677
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,330
You know we're able to
talk over each other.

1678
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,950
It's a beautiful thing that humans do.

1679
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,020
- Yeah and we're built
for this kind of community

1680
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,610
we're built for this
kind of communication.

1681
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,684
And we're not built to be alone,

1682
00:59:41,684 --> 00:59:44,800
which is essentially what
this epidemic has done.

1683
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,020
And the public health community

1684
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,970
said, look, that's what you need to do.

1685
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:49,830
- That's what you need to

1686
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:51,160
They're telling you be inhuman.

1687
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:51,993
- [Dr. Jay] Yeah.

1688
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:53,980
- And also now we changed our mind

1689
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:57,850
being human in this way,
instead of out there.

1690
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:58,683
Let me ask you something.

1691
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:00,199
So you look at the Asian countries

1692
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:01,040
cause you can look

1693
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,100
okay, okay U.S, Sweden,

1694
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,334
U.K, deaths, deaths.

1695
01:00:07,334 --> 01:00:08,240
- [Dr. Jay] Yeah.

1696
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,680
- Then you get to European Union deaths

1697
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,680
and then you get to New
Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong,

1698
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,303
whoa, actual viral suppression.

1699
01:00:19,303 --> 01:00:21,230
- I think there's a few
lessons to be learned for this.

1700
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:23,030
So New Zealand let's
come back to New Zealand.

1701
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,730
New Zealand is really, it's
super interesting on this front.

1702
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,170
I think that some of the Asian nations

1703
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,510
that suppressed the virus,

1704
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,960
they caught it very early on

1705
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,983
when contact tracing

1706
01:00:33,983 --> 01:00:35,520
the kinds of things that we say

1707
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,880
are like the mantra of like
test trace and quarantine

1708
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,851
actually can be effective.

1709
01:00:39,851 --> 01:00:40,890
- Early

1710
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:43,290
- Early, but by early April,

1711
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:45,390
50,000 cases in Santa Clara alone,

1712
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:46,223
- [Dr. Z] It's out of the bag.

1713
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:48,240
- I don't understand why people thought

1714
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,073
that that was go work.

1715
01:00:49,073 --> 01:00:51,460
- And how do you contact
trace asymptomatic cases.

1716
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,700
You'd have to test everyone

1717
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,150
hope there aren't a bunch
of false positives yeah.

1718
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,199
- Yeah so I think that
was a thinking mistake

1719
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:00,420
that the virus wasn't so widespread,

1720
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,610
we could use this strategy

1721
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:04,430
that seems like it was
working in Asian countries,

1722
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:05,840
but even in the Asian countries,

1723
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,290
I think there's some evidence that the,

1724
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,780
we talk about cross-reactive immunity.

1725
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,507
Like there were other
Corona Virus like infections

1726
01:01:11,507 --> 01:01:13,720
that they've had,

1727
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,590
they may have had

1728
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:17,740
some more extensive
cross-reactive immunity

1729
01:01:18,647 --> 01:01:20,547
more prevalent cross-reactive immunity

1730
01:01:20,547 --> 01:01:22,967
than European countries and the U.S had.

1731
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:23,800
- [Dr. Z] Right.

1732
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,950
- So I mean, I don't know.
- SARS-ish, yeah.

1733
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:27,783
- Who knows?
- Who knows right?

1734
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:30,400
- So I think we don't know fully

1735
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,449
why it didn't hit the
Asian countries as hard

1736
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:34,679
I think it's important to think about

1737
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:37,060
New Zealand is a really
super interesting example.

1738
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,430
They famously suppressed the disease

1739
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,950
at zero cases for 120 days.

1740
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:45,363
And then out of nowhere, the
cases start rising again.

1741
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,280
Okay, well, what did they do?

1742
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,490
They locked down again.

1743
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:54,490
The problem is like that
lockdown is now repeated forever.

1744
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,343
They have to keep repeating the lockdown

1745
01:01:57,343 --> 01:01:58,310
over and over again.

1746
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,590
- Or they'll just go through
what we went through.

1747
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,050
- And they're an Island nation
that depends on tourism.

1748
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:06,230
I mean fully, I think just like 10% of,

1749
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,480
very large fraction of GDP.

1750
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,440
Don't quote me on the number,

1751
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,170
but that large fraction of GDP
is gone basically permanently

1752
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,230
because who wants to
sit on 14 day quarantine

1753
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,063
to visit someplace.

1754
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:21,010
And people leaving the
Island are also gone already,

1755
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,100
so there's just the traffic

1756
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,090
in and out of the islands out

1757
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:26,475
So what you have is a continuous,

1758
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:29,240
and they've had like a
seven to 10% decrease

1759
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,823
in their GDP rate just this year.

1760
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,963
You don't keep that.

1761
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:38,750
If you wanna isolate yourself
from the rest of the world,

1762
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,330
you can do it, but it's
gonna take you enormous.

1763
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,180
It's gonna be enormous cost.

1764
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,290
And that is not an option
available in the United States.

1765
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:47,490
- Yeah absolutely, so the
New Zealand experience

1766
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,430
is interesting because they
are relying on something

1767
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,710
that may or may not happen,

1768
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:55,050
which is a safe and effective
vaccine as their savior,

1769
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:56,982
because what else could
they be waiting for?

1770
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,420
It's always gonna exist in the community

1771
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,730
at some level otherwise

1772
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,217
we have to learn to live with it.

1773
01:03:02,217 --> 01:03:03,640
And their way of living with it

1774
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,090
is shutting down their
entire Island forever.

1775
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,250
But they're probably waiting
for this finish line, right.

1776
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,083
- [Dr.  Jay] They're
waiting for the vaccine.

1777
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:10,740
- Now what's the risk of that?

1778
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,610
- Well, so the vaccine is,

1779
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:15,010
I have to say that more progress

1780
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:17,330
and rapid progress has
been made on the vaccine

1781
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:18,570
than I anticipated.

1782
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,610
If you'd asked me in April,

1783
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:22,070
that we'd be be here with Phase 3 trials,

1784
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,884
actually ongoing for
several vaccine candidates.

1785
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,684
I would have said there's no chance.

1786
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:30,590
I mean, there aren't any
human Corona Virus vaccines.

1787
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,470
- Yeah, often said that Paul
Offit had the same thing

1788
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:33,730
on my show vaccine expert.

1789
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,530
So at that time.

1790
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:38,539
- Okay, but now here's the situation

1791
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:41,062
we have these vaccine camps
that many and look promising

1792
01:03:41,062 --> 01:03:43,020
in the Phase 2 trials.

1793
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,140
The Phase 3 trials

1794
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,343
need to be on large populations of people.

1795
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:48,413
Why?

1796
01:03:48,413 --> 01:03:51,280
Partly because the cases
and deaths are declining,

1797
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,260
ironically, that makes it more difficult

1798
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,930
to show that the vaccine is efficacious

1799
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:55,763
because you just,

1800
01:03:55,763 --> 01:04:00,160
let's say you had the COVID vaccine

1801
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,720
before Corona Virus came along at all.

1802
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,120
Well, you'd never find it efficacious

1803
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,953
in preventing death

1804
01:04:05,953 --> 01:04:06,930
because there was no risk of Corona Virus.

1805
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:10,920
- Exactly, right, we're
making it harder now.

1806
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,690
- So the decline of the cases
and the decline in deaths

1807
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:15,530
makes it harder to show the vaccine works.

1808
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:17,810
- Yeah, yeah and that's
gonna make it more difficult

1809
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,560
to show efficacy.

1810
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,380
Safety we could still study.

1811
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,502
- Yeah safety we could study.

1812
01:04:22,502 --> 01:04:25,110
And there've been some
good news and bad news.

1813
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,760
Like many of the vaccine
candidates have been safe.

1814
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,593
In Phase 1 and phase,

1815
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:30,833
but they're reports now
there's a Transverse Myelitis.

1816
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:34,390
- Transverse Myelitis case
in the UK, Astra Zeneca,

1817
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,480
now that's a different
a viral model, right.

1818
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,476
Adenovirus, yeah.

1819
01:04:38,476 --> 01:04:40,977
So it's a different than the mRNA vehicle.

1820
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,553
- The mRNA vehicle hasn't really been used

1821
01:04:42,553 --> 01:04:43,414
in human vaccines before

1822
01:04:43,414 --> 01:04:46,140
- Ever, exactly, so it's totally novel.

1823
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,728
- So I mean, it could work.

1824
01:04:48,728 --> 01:04:51,410
It could still work, I think I'm waiting.

1825
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,800
I mean, if the data show
that it's safe and effective,

1826
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,633
I'll be first.

1827
01:04:54,633 --> 01:04:56,278
- I'll first in line I
have to look at that data.

1828
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:57,480
People have asked me,

1829
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,920
what will you and your
kids get this thing?

1830
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,753
Well, I'll tell you what,

1831
01:04:59,753 --> 01:05:02,143
as soon as I am convinced
that the data looks good,

1832
01:05:02,143 --> 01:05:06,310
I'll go do it because I
would like to get on a plane

1833
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:08,560
and go do things without thinking,

1834
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,600
well, I'm 47 so my risk profile is X.

1835
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,660
I have genetic clotting disorders

1836
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,070
and so endothelial dysfunction.

1837
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:16,991
So my risk is somewhere in the X.

1838
01:05:16,991 --> 01:05:18,620
That's how I calculate my own risk.

1839
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,410
So I take reasonable precautions,

1840
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:21,260
but I'm not crazy

1841
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,586
because I desperately
seek human connection

1842
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,773
and I'm willing to die rather than.

1843
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:31,070
- It's probably two to
three in 1,000 for me.

1844
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:32,883
Yeah I would rather live my life

1845
01:05:32,883 --> 01:05:34,670
with that two to three in 1,000 risks.

1846
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,857
If I happen to get it than not.

1847
01:05:36,857 --> 01:05:38,160
- But you're going to kill grandma

1848
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,392
by asymptomatically spreading it to her.

1849
01:05:40,392 --> 01:05:44,040
- When I visited my 80 year
old mom, I wore a mask.

1850
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,992
- There you go.

1851
01:05:44,992 --> 01:05:46,150
And that's what I would
do with my parents.

1852
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,520
So let me think here.

1853
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,348
What you just said is be rational.

1854
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:53,300
Take risk personally and
decide based on open data.

1855
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,030
Don't sensor people, let's have
actual scientific discourse

1856
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,650
instead of name calling
and politicization.

1857
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,439
And let's look at this
thing with clear, open eyes

1858
01:06:01,439 --> 01:06:03,000
and listen to all viewpoints.

1859
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,526
Is that about right?

1860
01:06:04,526 --> 01:06:06,903
- I mean, I've tried to be controversial.

1861
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:13,590
- Well, you've done a good
job by proxy in person

1862
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:15,280
and I haven't heard
anything that you've said

1863
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,550
that makes me go,

1864
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,860
oh my gosh, that's so controversial.

1865
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,920
It's called being rational.

1866
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,753
Now the thing is,

1867
01:06:20,753 --> 01:06:22,694
I'll get criticism even
on during this interview

1868
01:06:22,694 --> 01:06:25,200
that, oh, did you really
pound them on this

1869
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,033
and pound him on that?

1870
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:26,866
That's not my job.

1871
01:06:26,866 --> 01:06:27,950
My job is to say,

1872
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:32,600
here is a guy who has a
certain experience set

1873
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,950
that's very valuable.

1874
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:37,320
Let him talk about what he thinks

1875
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,350
and you guys can then debate
it in the comments openly.

1876
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,120
That's called scientific discourse.

1877
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,560
It's actually just discourse.

1878
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,670
And sometimes I wonder,

1879
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:46,170
because anything I post,

1880
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,880
you know, if I look at
Facebook, for example,

1881
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,000
which is our biggest platform,

1882
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,247
2 million people follow us there.

1883
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:55,030
If I put something there and
you start reading the comments,

1884
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,110
sometimes you wanna die a little

1885
01:06:57,110 --> 01:07:00,440
because it's like the movie
"Idiocracy" actually came true

1886
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,360
and you just go, oh,
and it's on all sides.

1887
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,200
It's all sides.

1888
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,270
- I get referee reports
all the time for my papers.

1889
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,110
So I'm used to that.

1890
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:08,970
- You're used to it right.

1891
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:09,870
You're used to it.

1892
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:15,850
So, we talked about Sweden a bit.

1893
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:17,018
We talked about New Zealand

1894
01:07:17,018 --> 01:07:18,627
and we talked about Asian countries

1895
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:20,360
and why they were different than us.

1896
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,170
We talked about the U.S.

1897
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:26,090
We talked about what we might
wanna do moving forward.

1898
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,157
So do you think cases are
just gonna continue to decline

1899
01:07:28,157 --> 01:07:30,490
and deaths are going to
continue to decline here.

1900
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:31,710
- I mean, there's two
points of view, right?

1901
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:34,820
So one is that there's
gonna be a second wave.

1902
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:38,573
That seems to be the Fowchee
point of view right now.

1903
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,366
I don't see much evidence of that.

1904
01:07:41,366 --> 01:07:44,290
Like we haven't started, in
the United States for instance,

1905
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,710
we talk about if we had a second wave,

1906
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,080
in New York and then the second wave,

1907
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,110
we hadn't had a second wave,

1908
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:50,459
we had is a regional epidemic.

1909
01:07:50,459 --> 01:07:52,680
Each place has had a first wave.

1910
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,556
That's what it looks like everywhere.

1911
01:07:54,556 --> 01:07:56,090
Now, it's possible

1912
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:56,923
I mean, we don't know

1913
01:07:56,923 --> 01:07:58,710
the thing has only been
around a few months

1914
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:59,920
that there could be one,

1915
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,220
but it's looking
increasingly unlikely to me,

1916
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,850
but we will see.

1917
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:06,490
- I'm with you.

1918
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,750
Based on current information,
I can be proven wrong

1919
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,520
and I've said this to my supporters,

1920
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,680
who there are people who
subscribe to the show

1921
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,403
and we do private live shows

1922
01:08:14,403 --> 01:08:16,600
there's like 7,000 number out of them.

1923
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,170
And I'll tell them things

1924
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,770
that I'm not comfortable, fully
vetted out for the public.

1925
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:22,910
So I go this is my feeling
right now based on data

1926
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,920
is that there is not a second wave

1927
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,010
in this classic sense,

1928
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:28,260
there may be a second wave casedemic

1929
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,529
where we start testing a lot.

1930
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:32,948
And we see a lot of asymptomatic,
positive PCR fragments.

1931
01:08:32,948 --> 01:08:35,769
The second thing is what
people don't seem to understand

1932
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:39,880
is that the first wave, like you said,

1933
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,990
was a geographic thing

1934
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:44,510
where in a cooler climates
like the Northeast,

1935
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:47,109
you saw massive rise and then a fall.

1936
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:49,209
In more Southern temperate climates

1937
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,720
is what you see what
kind of with influenza,

1938
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,090
which is a slower delayed
rise and a low, long hump.

1939
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:55,729
And they're calling that second wave.

1940
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:58,509
That's still all part of
the infectious pattern.

1941
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,460
And I think in the winter,

1942
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:03,300
it'll be interesting to see also schools.

1943
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,009
Tell me your thoughts on school.

1944
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:07,229
- I think it's criminal
not to open schools.

1945
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:08,349
- [Dr. Z] I agree with you.

1946
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:11,529
- Yeah, we talk about safety.

1947
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:15,739
It is more unsafe to not
let kids go back to school

1948
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,750
than to open up for schools.

1949
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:18,582
- Absolutely.

1950
01:09:18,582 --> 01:09:19,629
- We are harming kids

1951
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,970
in a way that is irreparable and immoral.

1952
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:23,340
- You're gonna get a
horse's head in your bed

1953
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,752
from the teacher's union on that one.

1954
01:09:25,752 --> 01:09:28,159
- I think a lot of teachers want to be

1955
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,252
that's their vocation is to teach

1956
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:33,340
and they wanna teach in person.

1957
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,700
How do you teach a first
grader to read over Zoom?

1958
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,910
- [Dr. Z] No, it's a crime.

1959
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:37,743
- Yeah.

1960
01:09:37,743 --> 01:09:39,330
- And the thing is they're
doing the best they can.

1961
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:41,040
It's very, very hard,

1962
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,979
but this is one of the things
that just gets me so upset

1963
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:47,889
because it's a regressive tax on the poor.

1964
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,130
So you're saying basically

1965
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:51,560
that a person who depends
on school for their meals,

1966
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,310
for their social interaction
for behavior control

1967
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:55,993
mom is a single mom and can't

1968
01:09:55,993 --> 01:09:59,140
it's and how is she gonna work

1969
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,653
we can hire nannies and
assistants they can't.

1970
01:10:02,653 --> 01:10:05,210
- I saw a picture, I think it
was in San Jose, Mercury News

1971
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,970
of two kids, Hispanic kids,

1972
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,130
sitting outside of a 7-Eleven

1973
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:11,130
with their little Google Chromebooks.

1974
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:12,690
- I saw that

1975
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,930
Using the 7-Eleven, the taco bell wifi.

1976
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,770
- To wifi 'cause they
don't have wifi at home.

1977
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:17,830
- [Dr. Z] That is disgusting.

1978
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:18,663
- It's terrible.

1979
01:10:18,663 --> 01:10:19,630
- It's heartbreaking.

1980
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:20,463
- And you know schools

1981
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:22,730
are not just simply places for teaching,

1982
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:25,880
although that is incredibly important.

1983
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,295
- You are Indian I knew it.

1984
01:10:27,295 --> 01:10:30,300
It's for teaching only nothing else.

1985
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,720
- But there are also places

1986
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,163
where kids get their nutrition.

1987
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,340
Somewhere I think on the
order of a third of kids

1988
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:40,380
in the country have
subsidized school meals

1989
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,710
of some sort or another,

1990
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:43,920
like a lot of their calories
get come from there.

1991
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,123
It's places where they learn to socialize.

1992
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:51,590
The long run consequences
of shutting that down

1993
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,620
are absolutely enormous.

1994
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,600
Even the short run,

1995
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,560
I suspect we'll start to see suicides

1996
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,030
jump up among adolescents

1997
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:02,640
School is good for their
mental health as well.

1998
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,330
- I have a close friend who's a physician

1999
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:09,282
whose daughter was 12, 13.

2000
01:11:09,282 --> 01:11:11,980
And during the lockdown started to exhibit

2001
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,790
just the worst anxiety.

2002
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,889
Like he would describe this to me.

2003
01:11:17,889 --> 01:11:20,120
And it was heartbreaking.

2004
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,198
This kid was beside herself

2005
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:25,810
and to the point where it was medications

2006
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:26,867
and psychotherapy and all that,

2007
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:29,860
and he affluent guy, so
he can afford all this.

2008
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,810
And then school started
some little bit in person,

2009
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:35,270
some little bit by Zoom

2010
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:39,260
and the anxiety started to evaporate

2011
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:43,060
and we forget that we're
the social animals.

2012
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,340
And especially kids.

2013
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,910
I used to look forward
as much as I love summer,

2014
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:48,350
you look forward to school starting.

2015
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:50,790
'Cause I'm gonna see Joey and Chad

2016
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:52,417
and we're going to hang out
and cause some crime, man.

2017
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:54,730
I mean, that was what it was like.

2018
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:55,700
- Yeah. I agree.

2019
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,406
I mean, I think for kids,
especially that playtime

2020
01:11:58,406 --> 01:12:01,153
is incredibly psychologically important.

2021
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:06,080
To deny them that seems...

2022
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,010
Okay it's one thing

2023
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:09,490
if they're really we're facing high risk.

2024
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:10,323
- So tell me about that

2025
01:12:10,323 --> 01:12:12,060
because the teachers will push back

2026
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,330
and say, but there's
teachers with chronic disease

2027
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,200
who are elderly, who.

2028
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,846
- I think we should that into account.

2029
01:12:16,846 --> 01:12:19,340
I think like different school districts

2030
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,150
should creatively manage that.

2031
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,900
So if you're a 62 year old teacher

2032
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,400
and you have diabetes,

2033
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,290
your school district to make
some accommodation for you.

2034
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:27,123
So you don't have teaching.

2035
01:12:27,123 --> 01:12:28,100
- [Dr. Z] Agree.

2036
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:28,933
- Absolutely.

2037
01:12:28,933 --> 01:12:29,790
- Do you think we should
be paying teachers

2038
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:30,623
more too in general.

2039
01:12:30,623 --> 01:12:31,456
- Yeah.

2040
01:12:31,456 --> 01:12:32,289
- [Dr. Z] As an economist.

2041
01:12:32,289 --> 01:12:36,960
- I think there's some debate in economics

2042
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,020
about how much extra pay
correlates to outcomes.

2043
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,080
But as a whole teacher,

2044
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,670
I mean, I honor my teachers,

2045
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:45,510
I think they did incredible things for me.

2046
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:46,343
- [Dr. Z] Me too.

2047
01:12:46,343 --> 01:12:47,460
- And also for the kids.

2048
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,880
So I'm not against that.

2049
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,822
I'm fine with that,

2050
01:12:49,822 --> 01:12:52,200
But I think we should use the resources,

2051
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,020
different school districts
use the resources they have

2052
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,150
to creatively manage

2053
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:57,239
so that kids can actually come in person.

2054
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,072
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

2055
01:12:58,072 --> 01:12:59,580
- In some places, maybe
you can't social distance,

2056
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,454
you need more masks

2057
01:13:00,454 --> 01:13:03,610
in places where you can social distance,

2058
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:04,443
you can figure it out.

2059
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:06,600
I mean, you have to
creatively manage that.

2060
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,670
Young teachers who face very
little risk, let them come in.

2061
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:11,120
The older teachers who are at risk,

2062
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,861
they can maybe they can
help the younger teachers

2063
01:13:14,861 --> 01:13:18,300
by helping them grade, create
curriculum, teach online.

2064
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,210
I mean, I think there's some mix,

2065
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:21,590
but the absolute must

2066
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:23,430
is you have to have the kids in person.

2067
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:25,160
- [Dr. Z] Yeah, yeah.

2068
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,580
- With each other or else you
can't actually have school.

2069
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,070
- Now, you know what I
think is happening too.

2070
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,290
And it's related to this
is this safety creep.

2071
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:34,350
So in the early days of this thing,

2072
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:37,100
when they talked right here in the Bay

2073
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,610
about shutting down schools,

2074
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,840
we were thinking it'll
be two, three weeks.

2075
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,000
And then they said,

2076
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,936
it's gonna be till the end of the year,

2077
01:13:43,936 --> 01:13:45,439
the school year

2078
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:48,920
There was absolute horror and panic

2079
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,440
on the part of parents and kids

2080
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,680
like what, you're doing what.

2081
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,670
Now, when school's supposed
to reopen it doesn't

2082
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:58,210
and people have just accepted it as well.

2083
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:00,269
All right we're keeping people safe now.

2084
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,370
It's the norm.

2085
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,400
Our kids are slowly dying a little

2086
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,220
we're destroying poor families.

2087
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,090
We're creating a cycle of poverty,

2088
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:08,500
violence, substance abuse,

2089
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,750
but you know what?

2090
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,370
Safety safety first.

2091
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:13,203
- It's not safe.

2092
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:14,890
- [Dr. Z] It's not safe
it's the opposite of safe.

2093
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,480
- Yeah and if you think

2094
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,230
about what the scientific
evidence is saying,

2095
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:22,830
the teachers and staff pose
more of a risk to each other

2096
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,581
than the kids pose to them.

2097
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:29,581
There's a study done by
this group in Iceland.

2098
01:14:30,489 --> 01:14:31,970
It was published in New England Journal.

2099
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,070
It's absolutely fascinating.

2100
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:36,440
So what they did is they
took 12% of random sample

2101
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,720
of the Icelandic population.

2102
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,750
And they did PCR testing on
every single one of them.

2103
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,910
And they identified the
virus from every single one

2104
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:44,315
that was positive.

2105
01:14:44,315 --> 01:14:47,350
And they sequenced the
genome of every virus.

2106
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,183
Why is that important?

2107
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,700
Because the virus has
these mutations there,

2108
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,680
give it like a fingerprint.

2109
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,440
And they did this detailed
contact tracing study where they,

2110
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,398
and because they did the genetic analysis,

2111
01:14:56,398 --> 01:14:59,497
like let's say, I have
virus A with mutation

2112
01:14:59,497 --> 01:15:01,250
and you have virus A and B.

2113
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:02,083
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

2114
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,160
- With mutation A and B.

2115
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,320
Well, it's possible
that I passed it to you

2116
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,370
because you added on mutation B,

2117
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,510
but it's unlikely you pass it to me.

2118
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:10,343
- [Dr. Z] Right.

2119
01:15:10,343 --> 01:15:11,417
- And if I have just a mutation A

2120
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:12,740
and you have just mutation B,

2121
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:13,920
then we didn't pass it to each other.

2122
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,970
- Right separate sources yeah.

2123
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,700
- Okay, what they found was that

2124
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,760
there was not one single case

2125
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,310
of a child passing into an adult.

2126
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,010
- Not one case.

2127
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:27,030
- Many, many cases of parents
passing it to their kids.

2128
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,863
- [Dr. Z] Yeah.

2129
01:15:27,863 --> 01:15:28,730
- But not one the other way.

2130
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:31,130
- So why are we ignoring this data?

2131
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:31,963
- [Dr. Jay] I don't know.

2132
01:15:31,963 --> 01:15:34,035
- And so here's the counter

2133
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:35,960
that the mainstream media will say,

2134
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,970
well, look at what's
happening at Notre-Dame

2135
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,387
or wherever there's thousands
of cases and, oh, my God.

2136
01:15:41,387 --> 01:15:43,020
- Not one hospitalization, by the way.

2137
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:43,853
- [Dr. Z] Not a single one.

2138
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:45,630
- Yeah and I mean, talking
about college kids right.

2139
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:48,020
So there's not one hospitalization.

2140
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,360
- Now, but what about these
it's just these horrible vectors

2141
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,700
of disease for the elderly.

2142
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,944
- I mean, asymptomatic spread happens.

2143
01:15:53,944 --> 01:15:55,830
That's what the evidence says,

2144
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:59,070
but it's much less common
than symptomatic spread.

2145
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:02,130
So the diseases spread
by mostly by droplets,

2146
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:03,490
you can have these aerosolization events

2147
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:04,323
it seems like,

2148
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:05,700
but they're relatively rare

2149
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,030
compared to the droplet spread,

2150
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,150
- [Dr. Z] Right.

2151
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,873
- Asymptomatic spread happens,
but it's much more rare.

2152
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,850
Just to give you some sense,

2153
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:20,520
Sweden kept its schools open
15 and under including daycare

2154
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,120
all the way through the epidemic.

2155
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,290
Even when cases were rising,

2156
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:24,800
even deaths were rising.

2157
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,093
And they did this detailed
study compared to Finland.

2158
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,780
Opening and closing the
schools does not have

2159
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:36,010
any appreciable effect on
the spread of the epidemic.

2160
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:38,100
- The what the hell are we doing?

2161
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,560
- I don't know, I don't know.

2162
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,508
I think the evidence on this is so strong.

2163
01:16:42,508 --> 01:16:44,650
And you read it and you just weep

2164
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:46,285
because you're saying, okay, we're making

2165
01:16:46,285 --> 01:16:48,895
a scientifically uninformed decision.

2166
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:50,420
- You know what it is.

2167
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:52,120
It is also coming to this thing

2168
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,700
of what I call empathy versus compassion.

2169
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,240
So empathy is feeling another
person's pain as your own

2170
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,630
and acting from that feeling.

2171
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:00,820
They ask us to do this

2172
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,550
in medicine all the time, more empathy.

2173
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:05,770
But what they don't realize
is empathy is a poison

2174
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:06,920
when it comes to things like this,

2175
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,490
because here's what happens,

2176
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,830
I read an in some mainstream media piece

2177
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,991
about a 28 year old teacher

2178
01:17:12,991 --> 01:17:15,830
who died of COVID after school was open

2179
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,510
and you go, oh, my God,
the young teacher died

2180
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:19,740
we should never have opened the school.

2181
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,740
I feel for her and her
family and she's young

2182
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,570
and we should just stop everything.

2183
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:25,400
Whereas when you look at the case,

2184
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,892
okay, what were the comorbidities?

2185
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:27,811
They were there.

2186
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:29,150
What's going on?

2187
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:30,020
And that's one person.

2188
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,170
Did she get it from school?

2189
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:33,410
We don't know, could have
gotten it somewhere else,

2190
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,360
but we're going to now fail to do

2191
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,260
what we ought to have done,

2192
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,450
which is compassion, which
is cognitive empathy.

2193
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,430
Understand the suffering.

2194
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:42,950
Look at the bigger picture.

2195
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,700
What's the most wise thing
we can do for the most people

2196
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,960
to relieve the suffering

2197
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,040
and detach a little bit.

2198
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,050
Well, if you do that, you
go, actually that's true.

2199
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,890
But we could have provided
masks to the teachers

2200
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:56,070
and given schools an opening

2201
01:17:56,070 --> 01:18:00,250
so that these children who are
dying of diseases of despair

2202
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,920
or are going to, get a chance.

2203
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,753
But we don't do that.

2204
01:18:03,753 --> 01:18:04,653
- I mean, you're arguing for it.

2205
01:18:04,653 --> 01:18:06,230
I mean, that's a really
nice way to put it.

2206
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:07,326
You're arguing for empathy for everybody.

2207
01:18:07,326 --> 01:18:10,900
Not just for like the select few.

2208
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,270
- And the trick about empathy

2209
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,390
is it doesn't work on everybody.

2210
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:15,920
So Paul Bloom has written
about this, psychologist.

2211
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,038
It is a narrow spotlight,

2212
01:18:18,038 --> 01:18:20,588
not just on individual, but on tribe.

2213
01:18:20,588 --> 01:18:23,840
So empathy evolved for as an in-group way.

2214
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,990
So for your kids, empathy
is absolutely appropriate.

2215
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:28,365
My God, you better feel their
pain 'cause they are you,

2216
01:18:28,365 --> 01:18:32,720
but for a population you
don't empathize with them.

2217
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,770
And the charities have
known this for years.

2218
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:37,680
They don't show you a
population of starving people.

2219
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:41,700
They show your help can help this child,

2220
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,810
you know, Sally in Sub Saharan Africa,

2221
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,290
look at her and then you go, absolutely.

2222
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,360
'Cause that's how we're wired.

2223
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,193
- Interesting.

2224
01:18:49,193 --> 01:18:50,026
- [Dr. Z] It's really interesting.

2225
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:52,020
- I think that's really right.

2226
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,700
But I think compassion in the sense

2227
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,680
that you mean it exactly
the right thing here.

2228
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,920
So we have to understand.

2229
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,580
So like the scientific evidence

2230
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:02,640
says that the teachers
face about as much risk

2231
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,023
as other professions doing their work,

2232
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,970
not from the kids again,
from other staff members.

2233
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:13,057
But you act on that.

2234
01:19:13,057 --> 01:19:15,230
You said, okay, well,
given that that's the case,

2235
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:17,010
so let's structure the workplace

2236
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:19,590
to reduce that risk as much as we can.

2237
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,990
What they're doing is a
vital function for the kids,

2238
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,913
for society at large, they
are absolutely essential.

2239
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,770
So they're, they're taking a risk.

2240
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,330
We should honor them for taking that risk.

2241
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:31,630
Just like we honor the
doctors that have come in

2242
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:32,540
or the nurses that have come in

2243
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,740
to come to care for their patients.

2244
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:37,760
They're not doing something
as less vital than that.

2245
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,140
- It's funny 'cause you'll see memes

2246
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,020
where it was like,

2247
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,330
teachers will say, we
didn't sign up for this.

2248
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:44,560
And the nurses will say, neither did we.

2249
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,610
We didn't sign up to
put ourselves at risk,

2250
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,350
but we do our essential job.

2251
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,730
Someone wrote a nurse wrote
an Op-ed and it shouldn't,

2252
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:53,420
it's not a real contest
between who's the bigger martyr

2253
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,670
it's the idea is that they're both honored

2254
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,163
as absolutely essential.

2255
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,640
And it's tough because you
do feel for people too,

2256
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,520
who are at risk and
that's why it's nuanced.

2257
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,920
And it's something you
even opened the show with

2258
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,340
where you said you're heartbroken

2259
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,572
about the suicide statistics.

2260
01:20:07,572 --> 01:20:10,160
That's because what you're showing is love

2261
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,580
in the face of suffering.

2262
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,070
Love and concern in the face of suffering

2263
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:15,310
will lead you to feel that way, right.

2264
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,690
Because you go, I can't, this is terrible.

2265
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:21,694
So let's have the discourse
from a place of compassion

2266
01:20:21,694 --> 01:20:23,910
and the way that you've been treated,

2267
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,410
I think is just abhorrent

2268
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,630
because that's not a
compassionate response.

2269
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:30,610
It's let's talk if we
disagree, that's fine.

2270
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:32,050
And then we can have the argument,

2271
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:34,450
but why are we vilifying people?

2272
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:37,470
- Yeah, I don't have much to complain.

2273
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:39,960
I actually have been
fortunate in many ways.

2274
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,160
And actually it's been interesting

2275
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,930
from a professional point of view

2276
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:45,268
to be able to contribute at all to this.

2277
01:20:45,268 --> 01:20:48,263
In many ways gratifying that
I've had something to say,

2278
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,970
but I completely agree
with the spirit of it.

2279
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:54,030
Let's look at the data.

2280
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:56,700
Let's make decisions that understand

2281
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,570
that we're making decisions

2282
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:02,210
that affect the lives of everybody,

2283
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:03,377
not just the people with COVID

2284
01:21:03,377 --> 01:21:08,377
and COVID is not the only public
health danger that we face.

2285
01:21:08,987 --> 01:21:12,670
And that there are trade offs,
there's risks on all sides.

2286
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:15,370
There's not a safe
option where we can say,

2287
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,330
and so I think like
cheap rhetorical tricks,

2288
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:20,170
like, oh, you only care about the economy.

2289
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,010
You don't care about lives.

2290
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,568
I think for the most part

2291
01:21:22,568 --> 01:21:24,930
it's aimed at shutting
down just conversation

2292
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:27,100
as opposed to having serious conversation.

2293
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,586
- Yeah, I agree, I agree.

2294
01:21:28,586 --> 01:21:31,560
Man, was there anything
else you wanna talk about?

2295
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,240
- I think we covered it, thank you.

2296
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,073
- Oh my gosh,

2297
01:21:35,073 --> 01:21:37,290
this was such a enjoyable
conversation for me

2298
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:40,140
because it allows an airing

2299
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,180
of this kind of side of the conversation

2300
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:45,230
that I just don't think we're
getting in a clear eyed way.

2301
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:48,561
So if mainstream media does
it, it's politicized by Fox.

2302
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:52,990
If the left does it, it's
politicized by the media,

2303
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,610
I'm trying to create a space here

2304
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,180
and hopefully we can
have more conversations

2305
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,740
where we just get out some
interesting information

2306
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,630
in a clear way.

2307
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:02,690
- Well, I'm really honored
to be able to talk with you.

2308
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:04,950
And actually it's been really interesting

2309
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,233
to be able to have this
conversation as open.

2310
01:22:07,233 --> 01:22:08,160
I think there's stuff

2311
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,900
we probably disagree on a little,

2312
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,100
I don't know what time.
- Sure.

2313
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,470
- But I think having a space
where you can actually do that,

2314
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:15,900
I think all of science
should be like that.

2315
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,160
- I 100% agree.

2316
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,280
So we're gonna try increasingly

2317
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,230
to use the space for that kind of good.

2318
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:24,490
Guys like, I mean, this was a conversation

2319
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,520
you can disagree I want you to,

2320
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,780
I want you to leave comments.

2321
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,990
I want you to leave ad
hominem attacks out of it,

2322
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,823
if you can,

2323
01:22:30,823 --> 01:22:32,380
let's try to use our critical thinking.

2324
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,320
Do me a favor Just share this thing.

2325
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,820
It'll be on a podcast.

2326
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,930
It'll be on my website zdoggmd.com.

2327
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:38,830
It'll be on YouTube.

2328
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:39,850
It'll be on Facebook.

2329
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:40,760
Ultimately what we do

2330
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,830
is we make a little square
out of it and caption it

2331
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:44,742
and put it on Facebook
too so you can read along.

2332
01:22:44,742 --> 01:22:46,759
The transcript will be
out in a couple of days.

2333
01:22:46,759 --> 01:22:48,450
I love you guys.

2334
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,283
Please stay well.

2335
01:22:49,283 --> 01:22:52,620
Please let stop stifling
discussion and having it.

2336
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:55,280

2337

[storyline]
orig = Most of the Navy Seals team that allegedly killed Osama Bin Laden have been assassinated. Coincidence?\nRemember the chants of "USA! USA!" by the sheeple? Well, USA! USA killed their best!\n\n\nAnyone can be "taken out". Doesn't matter which service or department you work for. If it needs covering up and you are getting in the way - you'll be pushing daisies!\nTwo FBI agents that arrested one of the suspected "Boston Bomber", died while training how to jump out of a helicopter. Doesn't it remind you of the scene from Scarface?

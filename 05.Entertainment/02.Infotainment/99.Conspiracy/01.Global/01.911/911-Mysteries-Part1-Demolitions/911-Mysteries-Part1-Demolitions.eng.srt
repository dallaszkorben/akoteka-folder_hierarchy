00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
My name is Brad and I'm a conservative Republican

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Last summer I happened to come across a video on the Internet about the World Trade Center demolition on September 11th

3
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,700
As a kind of demolition hobbyist, I downloaded it and watched it

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,900
The title was Painful Deceptions, by a guy called Eric Hufschmid

5
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,100
The video made me very angry

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,800
I was determined to prove the maker of the video wrong

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,400
I purchased videos about 9/11 from CBS and PBS Nova, including one made by the Naudet brothers

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,100
These were considered the official videos

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,300
After watching them carefully, and after researching thousands of websites and archives on the Internet

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,400
literally not sleeping for an entire week

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,600
I realized that official story, not Eric Hufschmid's Painful Deceptions, was unprovable,

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,700
unsubstantiated, absolutely wrong

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,900
What you are about to see is information you should already know

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Our news reporters, government and media should have made all this material available to every one of us

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Ask yourself why you've never seen it on TV

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,900
This is as close as we can get to the base of the World Trade Center

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,500
You can see the firemen assembled here, the police officers, FBI agents

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
911 Mysteries
Part 1: Demolitions

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
The Myth

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:00,500
On September 11th, we learned that four passenger planes were hijacked and taken radically off course

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Within an hour, two of the planes had flown into the enormous steel towers of the World Trade Center,

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,500
creating fires and eventually toppling them

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Dazed by the news, the American public soon believed

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,600
the fires in the towers had burned so hot they caused the steel frames of the buildings to give way

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
A myth developed,

26
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,700
fed by official sources through the media to a bewildered audience 

27
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Elements of the myth: the impact of the airplanes, gallons of burning jet fuel, steel melting, 

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the buildings failing and suddenly imploding

29
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,100
In a mere 10 seconds, 110 stories hurtled earthward,

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,200
pulverizing into dust

31
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Right from the start, on the street itself, the official story was born

32
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,100
..come out of nowhere and just reamed right into the side of the Twin Tower, exploding through the other side,

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,200
and then I witnessed both towers collapse, one first and then the second, mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense 

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,400
The myth bled into the FEMA report and was echoed by the experts

35
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,900
It was the combination of impact load doing great damage to the building, followed by the fire, that caused collapse

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Gene Corley, PhD., American Society of Civil Engineers

37
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:02,800
John Skilling and Les Robertson were the structural engineers who designed the streamlined steel frames of the Twin Towers in the 1960s

38
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,300
Because a wayward army bomber flew into the Empire State Building in 1945,

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,400
the towers were built with skyscraper crashes in mind

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,600
The airplane we were envisioning was the largest airplane of its time,

41
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,700
flying slowly and low, lost in the fog

42
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,900
We designed the buildings to take the impact of the Boeing 707, hitting the building at any location

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,600
[Official story] But the aircraft that hit the towers was a Boeing 767, heavier than a 707, 

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,000
fueled for a transcontinental flight and traveling fast

45
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Boeing 707 and 767 are comparable

46
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,700
The maximum take-off weight of a fully loaded 707 is almost 334,000 pounds

47
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,700
As airplanes only carry the fuel load they need, the smaller-model 767s that struck the towers

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,300
were not, in actuality, maximally fueled

49
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,400
or close to their maximum take-off weight

50
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,400
As for the heat of the fires, listen to the radio communications of these New York City firemen:

51
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,000
78 floor, we've got two isolated pockets of fire

52
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:31,100
We should be able to knock it down with two lines. Radio that, 78th floor

53
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Isolated pockets of fire. Two water lines to knock them down

54
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:47,100
FEMA's Executive Summary relays that much of the fuel in the planes (jet-grade kerosene) was consumed by the initial fireballs,

55
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,700
and the following few minutes of fire

56
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
It then tells us:

57
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,900
[Official story] The burning jet fuel spread between floors and ignited the building's contents,

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
causing more fire and generating heat

59
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:07,600
This was somehow enough to bring down the towers' 47-column steel core,

60
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,200
236 exterior columns and thousands of steel trusses, all at the same time

61
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Watch the towers smoking in the aftermath of the plane strikes

62
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
If you have ever tried to light a wood fire,

63
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
you will know that smoking logs tell you the fire is NOT burning successfully

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Smoke is the sign of an oxygen-starved fire

65
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,100
The Twin Towers stood for over an hour, smouldering but not flaming

66
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,400
During that time, thousands of people were evacuated by way of the stairwells

67
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,400
Others, trapped by debris, stood in the smoke-filled windows and signaled for help

68
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
In fact, the towers did what they were built to do

69
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,900
The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it

70
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That was the largest plane at the time

71
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:12,100
I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners

72
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,200
because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door

73
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,900
This intense grid

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting,

75
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,600
it really does nothing to the screen netting

76
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,300
The towers were built to withstand 140-mile-an-hour (220 km/h) gusts produced by winter storms

77
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Anyone in them on a windy day could feel them swaying

78
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,800
The single impact of a jetliner was no more of a blow than the continued battering of a hurricane

79
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I was just putting my stuff away and all of the sudden we heard a loud crash

80
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,900
and the building started shaking, kind of moving like a wave..

81
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,900
New Yorkers were stunned, one hour later, when the first tower fell

82
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:16,900
[Official story] To the best of my knowledge, the considerations of the fuel in the airplane, in terms of an explosion or a great fire

83
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
! was not considered !

84
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,200
We were not responsible for that aspect of the design

85
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,900
Imagine:

86
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:33,100
building expressly for airplane impact, but never thinking of the fuel

87
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Steel Buildings

88
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Never before in the history of the world has a steel building collapsed due to fire

89
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,700
I have not seen until recently a protected steel structure that has collapsed in a fire

90
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Jonathan Barnett, PhD., Worcester Polytechnic Institute

91
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,300
True infernos have raged hot and long in steel-framed buildings,

92
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
but not one of the buildings ever came down

93
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,400
In 1975, the World Trade Center's North Tower suffered a nighttime fire

94
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,600
that flamed for three hours, spreading vertically from floor to floor

95
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,100
It burned twice as long as the fires of 9/11, without even a hint of a building collapse

96
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,600
In February 2005, the Windsor Tower in Madrid, a skyscraper undergoing reconstruction,

97
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
sustained a 20-hour fire

98
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
This is what was left

99
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,800
a standing building strong enough to support a crane

100
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Compare a 20-hour inferno to 90 minutes of smoke

101
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Why are buildings made of steel ?

102
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Strong, light and flexible, steel frames offer many advantages over wood and concrete,

103
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,900
especially where skyscrapers are concerned

104
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Steel makes big buildings relatively light, with tremendous load-bearing capacity

105
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,300
The upper floors won't crush the floors beneath them, and steel holds up better to weather and fire

106
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,800
WTC Design and Construction

107
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Most skyscrapers are built on steel or concrete frames,

108
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
which is a grid of columns and beams that goes all the way through the building

109
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,900
The World Trade Center was different

110
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,100
It was what engineers call a "tube structure"

111
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,200
It was a very very strong mesh of steel that surrounded the exterior.

112
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Inside, there was the core

113
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,500
A rectangle of 47 columns made of 4-inch-thick steel at the base,

114
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
thinning with increasing height,

115
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,700
the cores combined might with ingenuity,

116
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
anchoring the towers and allowing them to flex

117
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,300
Look at the size of this steel

118
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Solid, pre-fabricated floor assemblies,

119
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,600
welded metal floor pans placed on top of trusses both welded AND bolted to the vertical frames

120
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:34,600
[Official story] This rock-like steel grid gave way because fire warped the trusses, causing the bolts to fail

121
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:40,700
As the trusses sagged and fell, the floors dropped with them

122
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,700
In its 2002 documentary "Why the Towers Fell," PBS creates a video model

123
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,700
Once the trusses failed, the floors they were holding cascade down

124
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,300
with a force too great to be withstood

125
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,500
The result is what's called a progressive collapse,

126
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,100
as each floor pancakes down on the one below

127
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,100
What remains standing ? The tall, indestructible core

128
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Why does PBS fail to explain the complete disappearance of the Twin Tower's cores ?

129
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The official story's central thesis is based on heat, temperatures high enough to weaken steel

130
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,100
But people in the towers did not report such heat

131
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
Think about it

132
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Neither steel, concrete, nor glass can burn

133
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,400
So what, in those buildings, could have burned to make such heat ?

134
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,900
How do these firefighters describe the collapse of the North Tower ?

135
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,300
We started running.. Floor by floor, it started popping out..

136
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,800
It was as if they had detonators. Yeah, detonators, yeah.. As if they planned to take down a building. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom !

137
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,400
All the way down. I was watching it and running

138
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,100
And others give similar descriptions

139
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,200
At 10:30 I tried to leave the building, but as soon as I got outside I heard a second explosion,

140
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,300
and another rumble and more smoke and more dust

141
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,500
And then a fire marshall came in and said we had to leave because if there was a third explosion, this building might not last

142
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,500
..like, it sounded like gunfire, BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG

143
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
And then all of the sudden three big explosions..

144
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,000
..started walking down the stairs to the 8th floor, big explosion, blew us back into the 8th floor

145
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,600
Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse ?

146
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,200
To me, it sounded like an explosion

147
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,700
Chief Albert Turi told me that he was here after the events that took place this morning

148
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
He tried to get his men out as quickly as he could,

149
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,200
but he said that there was another explosion which took place 

150
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,700
And then an hour after, there was another explosion in one of the towers here

151
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,600
So, according to his theory, he thinks there were actually devices that were planted in the building

152
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,600
Reports of bombs in the buildings, explosions

153
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,300
CBS reporter Carol Marin:

154
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I was coming toward the World Trade Center looking for CBS crews,

155
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,500
and asked a firefighter if he saw any

156
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
All of the sudden there was a roll, an explosion,

157
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,700
and we could see coming at us a ball of flame stories high

158
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Listen to the sound of a large explosion right before the South Tower begins to fall

159
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,300
This is as close as we can get to the base of the World Trade Center

160
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,400
You can see the firemen assembled here, the police officers, FBI agents

161
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Sound reaches us after what we see (in storm we see lightning before sound of thunder)

162
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,500
If the BOOM we just heard was the sound of the building collapsing, it would FOLLOW the collapse

163
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Instead, the BOOM is heard before

164
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Ho, whoa, whoa, bring it back

165
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600
Explosion

166
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,100
then the collapse

167
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Facts about Steel

168
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Let's consider the characteristics of steel

169
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Steel is an alloy of iron, containing added carbon for flexibility, workability and strength

170
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
In the days of old, blacksmiths heated iron till it was red and pounded it for hours to form it

171
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Horseshoes, knife blades and plowshares were typical creations

172
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Steel was introduced in the mid-1800s

173
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,300
and by the end of the century, with the advent of the blast furnace, found widespread commercial use

174
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:56,800
A blast furnace is known as a controlled environment. High temperatures are reached as oxygen is pumped into a closed space

175
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
How and when does steel melt ?

176
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,900
Steel melts at temperatures of 2750°F (1510°C) and above,

177
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
attained ONLY in a blast furnace or when a powerful incendiary such as thermite is used

178
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Steel, or any substance that is burned,

179
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,100
will never become hotter than the temperature of the fire or heat applied to it

180
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:31,100
An open-air hydrocarbon fire reaches a maximal temperature of some 1200°F (650°C)

181
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
in a "dirty" or uncontrolled burn 

182
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,800
characterized by red-orange flames

183
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,900
Red-orange flames are what we saw on September 11th

184
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Even the fireball caused by the plane strike was red-orange

185
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
A controlled burn falls between a dirty burn (like a fireplace)

186
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
and a controlled environment (the blast furnace)

187
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,900
A controlled burn employs a regulated mix of air and fuel

188
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,600
An example being your gas stove or the engine in your car

189
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,300
You can fire up your gas stove all day long,

190
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,900
making soup, roasting a duck or simmering a stew

191
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Made of steel, your stove will not melt

192
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,100
and nor will your pots and pans

193
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,300
This is a kerosene heater, designed for use in any ordinary house

194
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,500
The heater runs on jet-grade kerosene, contained in this tank

195
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Made of steel, the heater can operate all night and all day

196
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,700
The kerosene fumes ignite and burn inside it (1800°F/980°C), 

197
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,800
never causing even the smallest part of this heater to weaken or melt

198
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Yet we were led to believe that these tremendous buildings, framed in steel and surfaced in aluminum,

199
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,500
totally collapsed from small, scattered fires and 90 minutes of smoke

200
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,100
Take note of these hurtling beams,

201
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,300
thrown laterally outward as the tower comes to earth

202
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Would fire have the strength to eject such huge hunks of metal ?

203
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
MIT engineering professor Thomas Eagar's 2001 paper

204
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
is officially considered the academic standard for explaining the World Trade Center collapses

205
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,000
In it he tells us that steel loses half its strength at 650°C

206
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,600
and that the fires that day did not get much hotter than this

207
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,200
He stresses, however, that the fires did not burn evenly

208
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:47,300
It was the uneven temperatures that caused the steel to deform and some of the floors to fail

209
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,800
These falling floors brought down the whole building

210
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,900
While it was impossible for the fuel-rich, diffuse-flame fire to burn at a temperature high enough to melt the steel,

211
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
its quick ignition and intense heat caused the steel to lose at least half its strength and to deform, causing buckling or crippling

212
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:16,200
This weakening and deformation caused a few floors to fall, while the weight of the stories above them crushed the floors below, initiating a domino collapse

213
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,400
In plain language, straight from MIT: Fires not hot enough to melt steel

214
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Uneven fires deformed some of the steel

215
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,800
Some floors fell – smashing the entire building

216
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,500
Dr. Eagar ... what happened to the core ?

217
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Building Collapses

218
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
What do falling buildings look like ?

219
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
What do demolitions look like ?

220
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,100
We are seeing typical implosions,

221
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,200
characterized by gutting a building's base and then pulling it into itself

222
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Computer-controlled sequencing fires the explosives in a rapid wave

223
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Notice the jets of shooting concrete,

224
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,600
the flashes, the pops, the caving of the buildings as they fall into their footprint

225
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,700
The tremendous, billowing clouds of dust

226
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,700
Now let's look at the collapse of the Twin Towers:

227
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,700
We are seeing explosions, rather than implosions, a first in demolition history.

228
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,700
A sequenced rumble becomes a roar as debris is thrown outward

229
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
The damage is not contained

230
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Even the windows are blown from neighborhood buildings

231
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
What kind of energy enabled this ?

232
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Would fire hurl metal and concrete sideways into the air ?

233
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Here, a 600,000-pound (270 tons) chunk of steel, twice the weight of a Boeing airliner

234
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,900
was flung 400 feet (120m), wedging itself deep into Three World Financial Center on Vesey Street

235
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,400
A FEMA photographer taking pictures of Ground Zero wondered why so MANY steel beams were jutting from neighborhood buildings

236
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,500
What shot pieces of the towers all the way across the street ?

237
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:58,500
In April 2006 New Yorkers were distressed to learn that bone fragments - human remains from 9/11 

238
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,100
had been found on the roof of the nearby Deutsche Bank building

239
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,400
And how in God's name did those fragments get there ?

240
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,600
It surprised me that there was still bone fragments, or human remains, that had not been discovered

241
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:20,900
How is it possible that after five years they are finally looking on the rooftop of the Deutsche building ? I mean, that's crazy

242
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
And bone fragments less than a centimeter long

243
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,100
How could they be so small ?

244
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,100
So much to be explained

245
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Why did the South Tower fall first, when it was the second tower to be hit ?

246
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Watch the top third of Tower 2 leaning outward, about to topple

247
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Then, suddenly, it disintegrates in mid-air

248
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,900
What causes this giant slab of steel and concrete to turn into dust before our eyes ?

249
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Watch both buildings collapsing straight down - directly into the path of most resistance

250
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
which is all the floors and all the mass of the building itself

251
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The World Trade Center Towers came down in approximately 10 seconds

252
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:36,300
Seismic data from Columbia University puts the North Tower collapse at about 8 seconds

253
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
and the South Tower at approximately 10

254
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,700
Lynn Simpson, a survivor from the 89th floor of the North Tower, describes the sight:

255
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,200
And I saw the Trade Center literally collapse in upon itself floor by floor by floor

256
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,300
and it took seconds for it to happen

257
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,300
It was a massive building, and it just pancaked

258
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
10 seconds

259
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,600
These are 110-story buildings, coming to earth at free-fall speed

260
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,700
The rate at which an object drops through air

261
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,800
The lower floors would need to give way completely as the floors above them fell

262
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Can a person walk through a closed door as quickly and smoothly as one that is open ?

263
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:32,800
A 10-second collapse means the upper floors encountered no resistance from the undamaged floors beneath them.

264
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Watch the demolition wave rushing straight down

265
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Here the South Tower is half its original height,

266
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
but wreckage from the upper collapse has not yet fallen this far

267
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,000
We are watching a demolition moving faster than gravity itself,

268
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,100
a building bursting into powder from top to bottom

269
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Here, the core of the North Tower finally gives up

270
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,900
700 remaining feet (200m) of giant steel columns, among the strongest ever erected

271
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,900
What force acts upon the core to make it all of a sudden disappear ?

272
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Eric Hufschmid, author of the book “Painful Questions,” is a metal-cutting software engineer

273
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:36,100
The floors of the World Trade Center towers were a three-dimensional
mesh of steel beams

274
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,200
You have to keep in mind now, the floor is about an acre in size (65x65m),

275
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,300
there are thousands of joints all over it

276
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,400
In order for the floor to fall down, thousands of joints would have to break simultaneously

277
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,200
So then, if you look at the speed at which this came down, less then ten seconds

278
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,500
You blink your eye and thousand of joints just popped somehow

279
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
The only way you can explain that is with explosives

280
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,900
They had to have had explosives placed all over the floors at the primary joints 

281
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Then that would explain how all of the joints broke at such a rapid rate

282
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,100
The debris was crashing from one floor to the next

283
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:23,300
Debris cannot crash through steel and concrete floors as fast as it falls through the air

284
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
and there was no slowing

285
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Explosives had to be breaking the joints ahead of the falling rubble,

286
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,700
which is why the top half starts off collapsing slowly and then it starts picking up speed

287
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,200
This is a pancake collapse:

288
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,500
Why don't we see piles of floors at Ground Zero ?

289
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
And paper blown everywhere

290
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Wouldn't a pancake collapse have trapped the contents inside ?

291
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
What blew this paper all over New York ?

292
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:12,500
If you were to drop a billiard ball from the top of the Twin Towers, it would hit the ground in just over 9 seconds,

293
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,600
the average time it took for the towers to fall

294
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,800
Helped by gravity and falling through air, the ball will gain speed

295
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:32,300
The calculation for a "pure" pancake collapse of 110 stories, with each floor pulverizing to get out of the way, is 96 seconds.

296
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,900
In the real world, with the floors creating resistance,

297
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
a pancake collapse would lose speed - never would it gain speed

298
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Pre-collapse
Sub-basement explosions

299
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The airplanes struck the towers high above the ground

300
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:07,100
But down in the lobby of the North Tower, marble facing flew off the walls, the windows shattered, all the glass blown out

301
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,500
Guy from the Port Authority told them the damage was somewhere above the 78th floor

302
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,300
All you had to do was look around

303
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,000
It was obvious, something had happen right there in the lobby.

304
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:29,100
And you just saw, all the windows were blown out. The lobby looked like the plane hit the lobby

305
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Like the plane hit the lobby

306
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,700
What caused so much wreckage in the lobby ?

307
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:45,500
William Rodriguez, a maintenance employee at the World Trade Center and the last human being to exit the towers alive, describes a giant blast below his building

308
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:52,200
..and all of the sudden we heard an explosion. It was a huge explosion that came from under my feet,

309
00:28:52,300 --> 00:29:00,300
meaning that it came from the sub-levels between B2 and B3, and there was a huge explosion at the top of the building

310
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,800
You could hear the difference from the bottom and all the way through the top

311
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The one from the top, which was actually seconds after,

312
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,100
was heard very far away

313
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,200
The one at the basement was pretty loud, and you felt your actual feet moving with the floor

314
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:29,300
The tremor that is sent through the floors, the walls cracked and the false ceiling totally collapsed,

315
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,400
and that's when a person name Felipe David came running into our office saying: Explosion! Explosion! Explosion!

316
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:42,500
And when I saw him, he has all his skin pulled from under his armpits and missing pieces on his face

317
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,500
An explosion deep down in the tower, before the plane crash 95 floors above

318
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Others lived to report enormous explosions below the towers

319
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Construction worker Phillip Morelli was in North Tower Sub-basement 4 at the time of the first plane strike

320
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,600
I go downstairs. The foreman tells me to go to remove the containers

321
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,700
As I'm walking by the main freight car of the building, in the corridor, that's, that's when I got blown

322
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:19,800
I mean the impact of the explosion, of whatever happened, it threw me to the floor, and that's when everything starting happening

323
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,800
"Blown to the floor". Let's hear what happened next

324
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I was racing, I was going towards the bathroom. All of the sudden I
opened the door, I didn't know it was a bathroom

325
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:39,900
and all of the sudden a big impact happened again, and all of the ceiling tile was falling down, the light fixtures were falling, swinging out of the ceiling

326
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and I come running out the door, and everything, the walls were down, and now I start running towards the parking lots

327
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,300
There was a lot of smoke down there. There was a lot of people screaming. People came with us, running up the ramps

328
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,300
Philip then ran underground to the South Tower

329
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,400
You know, you gotta go clear across the hole from One to Two World Trade Center, you know, I mean that's the way you got to run,

330
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,500
and then all of the sudden it happen all over again

331
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Something else hit us to the floor. Right in the basement you felt it. Wall were caving in, everything that was going on

332
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,600
I know people that got killed in the basement, I know people that got broken legs in there, in the basement

333
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,600
People got reconstructive surgery because the walls hit them in the face

334
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:29,100
Engineer Mike Pecoraro in the sixth sub-basement, found the parking garage and machine shop reduced to rubble

335
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,300
Pre-collapse interior blasts

336
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Rescue firemen and civilians spoke of hearing explosions throughout the towers

337
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Firefighter Lou Cacchioli told People Magazine

338
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,400
that as he and others evacuated workers, bombs were going off inside the building

339
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,400
Explosions stalled elevators and filled entire floors with smoke and debris

340
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,400
I got an eyewitness that said there was explosion on floor Seven Eight, Seven Eight

341
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,400
We've just had another explosion

342
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,000
Warren Street because of the secondary explosion,

343
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,400
we've got numerous people covered with dust from the secondary explosion

344
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,400
We've got another explosion in the tower 10-13, 10-13 (This code = Fire Marshall Needs Assistance, Urgent Assist by NYPD)

345
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,500
We have a bigger explosion and what looks like a complete collapse, surrounding the entire area

346
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,600
I was involved in a secondary explosion..

347
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,400
William Rodriguez, helping the firefighters, reports blasts within the North Tower well before it fell

348
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,200
As I went up, I remember listening to small explosions on the upper floors,

349
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,800
and these small explosions were not coming from the area of the impact it was coming from lower floors

350
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,300
And when the second plane hit the South Tower:

351
00:32:53,300 --> 00:33:00,300
We heard “boom.” When we heard BOOM, inside our building, the North tower, we heard "pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop",

352
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:06,300
and on the security radio we heard, “We lost 65! We lost 65!” meaning the 65th floor collapsed 

353
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,300
And as we went down the stairwells you could hear the actual collapsing inside the building

354
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,800
You heard rumble. You heard the cracking of the walls. I mean pieces falling, right next to us, of the actual building

355
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Pre-collapse ground-level explosions

356
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,300
What happened at the base of the towers just before they came down ?

357
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Smoke appeared at street level

358
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,300
This video was shot from New Jersey

359
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,500
An explosion is heard as white smoke rises at the base of the building

360
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Watch the camera shake on its tripod as a large energy source rocks the ground

361
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Nine seconds later, the North Tower falls

362
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,300
I heard like an explosion and then a cracking type of noise, and then it sounded like a freight train,

363
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,400
rumbling and picking up speed. I looked up and I saw it coming down

364
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Firefighter Timothy Julian

365
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,500
As I came out of the North Tower, everything started trembling under my feet like an earthquake

366
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,600
The only thing I saw was a firetruck. I ran towards the firetruck and slid right under, when the building started to collapse right under the firetruck

367
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,700
William Rodriguez, WTC janitor

368
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
Pre-and mid-collapse explosions

369
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Across the Hudson River, Richard Siegel was filming an astonishing day

370
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,700
The sound meter of Richard's camera caught something very significant

371
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Adjusted for the distance involved (as sound travels more slowly than what we see),

372
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,700
the camera registered multiple explosions in the towers

373
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Here is the South Tower record:

374
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Then the building fell

375
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Squibs - visible explosions

376
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Let's look carefully at the collapse itself

377
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,200
Notice the puffs of concrete issuing from the sides of the building well ahead of the collapse wave

378
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Called "squibs" in demolition language,

379
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,300
these are actual explosives – charges firing visibly through the exterior

380
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,400
as gravity pulls the building down

381
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Here are more:

382
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Shattering from the top, engulfed by banana-peel plumes,

383
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,000
these were no ordinary implosions

384
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,500
The Twin Towers each consisted of three multi-story buildings set on top of one another

385
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,800
To sustain the weight of so many floors, the “sky lobbies” had to be extra-heavily reinforced

386
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Watch a big squib coming from the sky-lobby band

387
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Shockwave

388
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,300
A powerful blast produces what is called a "shockwave"

389
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Explosions generate extremely high compressional waves that exceed the limits of surrounding air and space,

390
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,500
creating a violent force

391
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,500
When the debris starting coming down I was right in the shadow of the South tower

392
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I was less then a hundred yards (100m) away

393
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Everybody saw the video, over and over again, of that cloud chasing people down the street

394
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,700
It was like a tornado

395
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,800
It was like being hit by a wave at the beach,

396
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,900
but the wave was intense, it was hot, it was noisy

397
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:30,400
It was like getting hit in the back by gravel, rocks, like somebody had picked up handfuls of rocks and was just throwing them at you

398
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,400
And the noise just kept coming and coming,

399
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,000
and one second I was running, and the next second I was flying

400
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,100
I had no control over my feet, no choice as to what direction I was going

401
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,300
I was in the air, and it seemed like I was being followed by this tornado

402
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
tornado of darkness

403
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,800
The South Tower fell first

404
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,900
This is the shockwave blast as it rocks the tower next door

405
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Pyroclastic surge

406
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,900
As the buildings fell, they darkened Manhattan,

407
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
filling the air with billowing clouds of dust and ash

408
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:27,300
What produces these huge, scudding cauliflower-like masses of slowly moving dust ?

409
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:38,300
True, a 110-story building has just been reduced to a million tons of rubble

410
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,300
But is there anything in our experience we can compare it to ?

411
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
A volcano

412
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,300
The US Geological Survey website provides us with a definition of a pyroclastic flow,

413
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,400
as a ground-hugging avalanche of hot gas and debris

414
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,400
The rising gas chimney is clearly visible in this photo of the North Tower implosion,

415
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:17,500
with pyroclastic flows between buildings

416
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,500
The cauliflower shape of the debris cloud is a telltale sign of pyroclastic flows

417
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:30,600
generated by massive explosions, typical of volcanic eruptions and controlled demolitions

418
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,600
A pyroclastic surge can even flow over water

419
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,700
as hot gases carry dust created by explosive energy

420
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Here, the South Tower implosion creates a pyroclastic surge, moving out over the Hudson River

421
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,200
A volcanic eruption produces exactly the same thick, scudding ash - heavy with debris,

422
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,800
hugging the ground as it flows out from a tremendous internal explosion

423
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,800
The slurry walls

424
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,800
On the southern tip of Manhattan, surrounded by water,

425
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,900
huge retaining walls were built below the World Trade Center

426
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to hold back the ocean and Hudson River

427
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The "bathtub" as it was called, held 7 levels of parking garages,

428
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,100
maintenance rooms and the New Jersey path train station

429
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:46,600
After September 11th, the 3-foot-thick slurry walls were found to have shifted up to 18 inches (45cm) inward

430
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,600
These walls are coming in. These wall hold back the river, 

431
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,300
so if these wall cave in, this place is going to get flooded out be the river

432
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Let's think about this

433
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,400
A pancake collapse should have left the foundations in place

434
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,000
They had always borne the weight of 110 floors

435
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,600
But something happened in the sub-basements to disrupt them

436
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,700
All the collapse had gone down to track level,

437
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,800
so we had 60, 70 feet (20m) of wall totally unsupported

438
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
What kind of force could have dislodged so many stories deep underground ?

439
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Molten metal

440
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The pile itself seemed to have a life of its own

441
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,500
It spewed fire when we dug into it

442
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
The ground continued to burn

443
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Les Robertson publicly reported that 3 weeks after the collapse, live fires burned and molten metal still flowed underground

444
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,500
You see how this is still smoking ?

445
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,600
That's from the fire still burning

446
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Eight weeks later we still got fires burning

447
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,300
Steel-toed boots is one of the biggest things

448
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Out still on the rubble it's still I believe 1100°F (600°C)

449
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,700
The guy's boots just melt within a few hours

450
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,200
In November 2005, physics Professor Steven Jones of Brigham Young University

451
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,300
published a 25-page treatise on the collapse of the Twin Towers and Building 7,

452
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,300
applying the laws of physics to the official story

453
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,800
From an interview on MSNBC:

454
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,900
As we read in the FEMA report, it says here, and I put this in my paper, of course

455
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:47,000
The best hypothesis, which is the only one they looked at, fire, "has only a low probably of occurrence."

456
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:53,100
"Further investigation and analysis are needed to resolve this issue". And I agree with that.

457
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,200
I'm sorry that we are out of time, and I'm not sure that you have fully..

458
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,400
Whoa! One other thing I want to mention.. Okay, if you could hit it, just really quickly

459
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Okay, here we go. Molten metal in the basements of all three buildings (WTC1,2 a WTC7)

460
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:13,600
And yet all scientists now reasonably agree that the fires were not sufficiently hot to melt the steel

461
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,600
So what is this molten metal ?

462
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,700
It's direct evidence for the use of high temperature explosives, such as thermite

463
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,300
Thermite produces molten iron as an end product

464
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,600
Okay, we appreciate your coming on,

465
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,700
even if I don't understand your theories. We appreciate your trying to explain it. Thanks

466
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,200
Professor Jones barely got in his mention of thermite

467
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,200
An incendiary used by the military,

468
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,700
thermite is a compound of iron oxide and aluminum

469
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,800
which when ignited, sustains an extreme heat reaction,

470
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,900
creating molten iron

471
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,400
In just 2 seconds, thermite can reach temperatures over 4500°F (2500°C),

472
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,900
quite enough to liquefy steel

473
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,400
This is thermite melting the engine of a car

474
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,600
We know that open-air fires cannot burn hot enough to melt steel

475
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,900
But metal had melted at the base of the towers

476
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:23,900
The second product of a thermite reaction is aluminum oxide visible as white smoke

477
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,700
Was thermite used in conjunction with explosives on September 11th ?

478
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,700
Watch this very bright substance pouring from the 81st floor of the South Tower

479
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,700
And white smoke appeared at the base of the building

480
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Would this be aluminum oxide, the byproduct of a thermite reaction ?

481
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,200
Appendix C of the FEMA Report describes sulfur residues on the World Trade Center steel

482
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,200
The New York Times called this the "deepest mystery" of all

483
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,200
Sulfur slightly lowers the melting point of iron

484
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,300
and iron oxide and iron sulfide had formed on the surface of the structural steel

485
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,800
Sulfur used with thermite is called thermate,

486
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
producing even faster results

487
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,500
The demolition industry

488
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,500
Let's look at what happens in the demolition industry

489
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Taking down large structures requires preparation

490
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:49,100
Powerful explosives and heavy equipment are used in advance

491
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,700
to weaken the foundation and bottom sections of a building

492
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,900
before additional explosives and gravity bring the rest of it down

493
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
The words of a senior blaster:

494
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,400
We blow the basement, all the columns in the basement

495
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Then we crack it up at the top to get it started

496
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,100
We go every other floor all the way down

497
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,700
Every explosive has a timer on it, that's why it's controlled

498
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:19,800
When the columns go, each floor goes down and impacts the one below and keeps going

499
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,300
Here's what demolition experts use in steel-framed buildings

500
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
The linear shaped charge

501
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
It's a chevron-shaped or v-shaped charge that you can focus at a specific target,

502
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,900
and it's lethal. It generates around 3 million pounds per square inch pressure (200 tons per square cm)

503
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,400
at a speed depending on the explosive inside the shaped charge, in excess of 27000 feet per second (8km per sec)

504
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Besides the unfathomably powerful shaped charge, blasters have a lot of tricks

505
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,000
There are over a thousand different types of explosives,

506
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,200
different because they detonate at varying speeds

507
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,700
This is detonating cord, and this burns at about 21000 feet per second (6 km/s)

508
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,900
With the use of delays, we can control pretty much where the debris lands

509
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,500
We can control vibration, we can control noise levels. Timing a delays are the keys to just about everything in our business

510
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
And what is the result ?

511
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
The thing that pleases me is the fragmentation and the control. When you take a building,

512
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,100
break it up into millions of pieces and put it into its basement,

513
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,200
as artfully as we do, and it works just like clockwork

514
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,200
9/11 WTC Demolitions

515
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Were the underground explosions intended to blow out the Twin Towers' basements

516
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,900
followed by blasts heard inside the buildings of shaped charges slicing the core ?

517
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,100
Demolition pre-weakening usually takes place well in advance of the final blast,

518
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,600
but at the World Trade Center critical prep work might have had to occur in a very compressed time frame

519
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,700
in the panicked aftermath of the plane strikes

520
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,200
These core columns were discovered after the collapse

521
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,700
The angled cut occurs exactly in the manner that shaped charges slice through steel beams

522
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,800
to control the way they fall

523
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,300
Notice the hardened once-liquid metal 

524
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,600
Was thermite used with the shaped charge ?

525
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,500
The job of the shaped charge is to cut steel H-beams

526
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,100
The way we do this is by cutting the beam at an angle 

527
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:13,200
which, through a series of beams cut at the same angle, will tend to make the building shift over and walk

528
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Let's look at the rubble of two 110-story buildings brought to the ground

529
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,700
In a 7-story crater, lie nearly 2 million tons of debris

530
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:35,200
Had the basements not been blown out, where would 2 million tons have gone ?

531
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Heaped on the ground, ready to slide and spill

532
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,400
The art of controlled demolition

533
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:03,900
Remember the pre-collapse and mid-collapse explosions caught by Richard Siegel's camera on the Jersey shore ?

534
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Were these the blasts that took the out core and upper basements just before the final crumble

535
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,500
a mind-boggling sequence of computer-controlled delays

536
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
that blew the exo-skeleton  pulverized the concrete

537
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,100
to bring the whole structure rolling to the ground

538
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,100
Was this the story of that day ?

539
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,600
1) Pre-collapse sub-basement explosions (lower basements and substructure)

540
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,700
2) Pre-collapse interior blasts (endo-skeleton, cutting core columns)

541
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,800
3) Pre-collapse ground-level explosions (upper basements and lower supports)

542
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,900
4) Top-level collapse initiation (cracking the top)

543
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,500
5) Mid-collapse squibs (shooting sections ahead of collapse)

544
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:59,600
6) Final time-delayed roll (exo-skeleton and pulverization)

545
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,100
Who knew ?

546
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,200
Some people appear to have known the imminent future on that fateful day

547
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,400
FEMA had arrived in New York on Monday night, ready for a bio-terror drill

548
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,500
Spokesman Tom Kenney:

549
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:27,500
To be honest with you, we arrived on late Monday night (10.sept - day before attacks!) and went into action on Tuesday morning,

550
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,600
and not until today did we get a full opportunity to work the entire site, other than this part of Church and Day to which we were deployed

551
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:42,100
And Rudy Guliani, Mayor of New York, tells ABC that he was aware the towers would be coming down

552
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,100
What's going on now is a massive rescue effort

553
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,200
And do you believe it is hundreds or thousands ?

554
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,700
I really don't want to say right now,

555
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,200
but I think it's going to be a horrible number

556
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,300
I saw people jumping out of the World Trade Center, I saw some of the firefighters who I know going into the building,

557
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,500
And we were in a building in which we were trapped for 10, 15 minutes,

558
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,600
and we set up headquarters at 75 Barclay Street which was right there

559
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,700
with the Police Commissioner, the Fire Commissioner, the head of Emergency Management 

560
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,800
and we were operating out of there when we were told the World Trade Center was going to collapse

561
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,100
..WTC was going to collapse!

562
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,600
Similarly, Larry Silverstein, new leaseholder of the World Trade Center,

563
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,700
regretfully declared that a decision was made to pull Building 7 by the end of the day,

564
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,800
the last structure added to the World Trade Center complex 

565
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Let's hear Mr Silverstein's actual words, delivered for our benefit in the 2002 PBS documentary America Rebuilds

566
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I remember getting a call from the fire department commander,

567
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,100
telling me they were not sure they we going to be able to contain the fire,

568
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,200
and I said: you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life,

569
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,300
maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it

570
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,400
and they made that decision to pull,

571
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,000
and then we watched the building collapse

572
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Blast, shoot, blow and pull are terms used in the demolition industry

573
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,600
to refer to bringing down buildings, bridges and other structures

574
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,100
Because I actually blew the hospital down that I was born in

575
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,200
Originally we had figured to shoot it, let it drop straight down

576
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:38,300
Then, watch Demolition Dynamics attempt a big blast

577
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,300
And from Ground Zero's own post-disaster wrecking crew

578
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:50,300
By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5

579
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,300
Oh, we are getting ready to pull Building 6

580
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:10,300
Silverstein, a commercial real-estate tycoon with international political connections,

581
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,400
acquired a 99-year lease on the World Trade Center complex in the spring of 2001

582
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Throughout the summer, he reworked the insurance policies on his new property, making sure that it was covered for acts of terrorism

583
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,400
Explicit in the lease agreement 

584
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:34,500
was Silverstein's right to rebuild the complex if it were destroyed

585
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:40,600
After 9/11, Mr Silverstein fought in his insurers court to obtain double his policy limits for the destruction of his property,

586
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:46,700
maintaining that the double hijacking constituted two disasters caused by terrorists, not just one

587
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,200
He won, and was awarded over $7 billion

588
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:58,300
a magnificent return on his original $15 million investment Silverstein

589
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:04,300
My first reaction is to think about the families  of those people, the tragedy, the magnitude of it

590
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,900
However, I firmly believe that we should rebuild

591
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,900
WTC Building 7

592
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:27,900
Just in the last few seconds another building, WTC 7, one of the buildings in support of the WTC towers, has collapsed

593
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,800
WTC 7, functioning as the command center for the complex,

594
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:38,900
housed giant diesel backup and oxygen systems, the Mayor's protected emergency bunker,

595
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,500
and offices for the CIA, Secret Service, Department of Defense and Securities

596
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,100
and Exchange Commission

597
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,600
Its other tenants were insurance companies, brokerages and banks

598
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,700
No plane hit Building 7

599
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,800
But at 17:20 p.m. on September 11th, it collapsed in a heap on the ground

600
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Some damage to Building 7 is said to have been caused by debris from Tower 1

601
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Though this New York Times article tells us Building 7 burned like a giant torch,

602
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,300
the only visuals that exist are of unidentified smoke

603
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,900
and a few small fires

604
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,400
Compare this to the wallops sustained by

605
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,900
WTC 3

606
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,100
WTC 4

607
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,800
WTC 5 and 6

608
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:36,800
Positioned right below the towers, damage to the surrounding WTC buildings was infinitely worse

609
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,300
Still, the structures held up

610
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,800
But somehow rescue workers knew that Building 7 would fall

611
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,500
Keep an eye on that building. It'll be coming down soon

612
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,500
A 47-story skyscraper, Building 7 folded neatly, in 6-and-a-half seconds

613
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,700
A textbook descent right into its footprint

614
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,700
Silverstein Properties now tells us 

615
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,800
that its owner was referring to the team of firefighters inside the building

616
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:15,400
when he spoke of the decision to pull - pulling the firemen out of harm's way

617
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,200
However, there were no firefighters in Building 7,

618
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,300
according to FEMA, NIST, and fire chief Frank Fellini

619
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,300
They were ordered out at 11:30 that morning

620
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,300
Six hours later, the building came down

621
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,300
Radio host Alex Jones notes the mark of a classic implosion

622
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,600
This is a photo taken one second into Building 7's collapse

623
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,500
Notice the crimp

624
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,100
If we look at other controlled demolitions,

625
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,500
we see that they first blow one of the central columns,

626
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,600
so the building falls in on itself

627
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,700
If you don't do this, the building falls outward,

628
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,800
and can damage surrounding structures

629
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,800
Building 7 had a classic crimp, or wedge

630
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,900
Its central column was blown out first,

631
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
so it didn't structurally damage buildings just a few feet away from it

632
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,400
Remember the Mayor's emergency bunker ?

633
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,000
Ensconced on the 23rd floor of Building 7,

634
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:34,100
it was retrofitted with super-glass, water, oxygen and its own generator

635
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,600
But Mayor Guiliani chose to find emergency shelter elsewhere on September 11th

636
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,600
Why Building 7 ?

637
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,700
Even the media and its experts were confused

638
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,900
The History Channel interviews structural engineer Ramon Gilsanz

639
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
who points out the obvious crimp and even speaks of the implosion

640
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,500
Engineers are not just focusing on the Twin Towers

641
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
The most disturbing structural even was not that the Twin Towers fell, but that Tower 7,

642
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,300
ignited by flying debris, fell due to fire alone

643
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,400
Building 7 was a steel-framed building, and it's the first steel-framed building

644
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
that has collapsed due to fire 

645
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:22,600
The failure of the building was an implosion. It failed completely different from Towers 1 and 2, in which the floors failed first

646
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,600
Why Building 7 ? Let's ask the question again

647
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:35,600
As the WTC command center, was it the hub for the 9/11 plan ?

648
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:45,100
Also, in 6-and-a-half seconds, lost forever were thousands of SEC case files on corporate fraud,

649
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,600
including those relating to the notorious activities of giants Worldcom and Enron

650
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,600
A few indictments for stock fraud,

651
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:59,700
but what of the $70-billion-dollar California electricity swindle ?

652
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,700
It disappeared

653
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,700
Tower security and evacuations

654
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,700
No one died in the collapse of Building 7

655
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,700
It was vacated well in advance of its implosion

656
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,800
But not the Twin Towers

657
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:21,900
Why weren't police, firemen and civilians in these buildings told what to expect ?

658
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:27,100
Tragically, employees in the towers were advised to return to their offices

659
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,200
The announcement came on that everything was fine

660
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:36,700
Tower 1 they were evacuating, but Tower 2 was fine, and we could go back to our offices

661
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:41,700
We were about to go through the turnstile. The security guard says: Where you guys are going ?

662
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,800
I said: Well, I'm going home because I saw fireballs coming down

663
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,000
He said: No, your building is safe, it's secured. It is safer to stay in your building. Go back to your office

664
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,500
Stanley returned to the 81st floor then

665
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:02,200
I just happened to raise my head, looking straight towards the Statue of Liberty,

666
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:06,300
and what I say was a giant airplane coming straight towards me

667
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,800
The South Tower was hit between the 78th and 84th floors

668
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,300
Trapped on the 81st floor by crushing debris, Stanley was rescued by Brian Clark

669
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:26,300
Slowly and painfully, they made their way down a stairwell to freedom

670
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:33,300
Outside, Stanley had a feeling of uncanny prescience for what was to come

671
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,300
And we peered through railing up through the trees at the tower

672
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,800
and Stanley said: You know, I think that tower could come down

673
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:48,300
I don't know why I am telling this man, but I knew it was not over

674
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:54,800
And I said: There's no way. That's a steel structure. That's just draperies and carpets and furniture burning. You know, there's no way..

675
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,900
and I didn't finish my sentence when the tower started to slide

676
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,400
And I can still remember hearing, first of all, this boom, boom, boom - explosions 

677
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,600
Not all were blessed with intuition or foresight

678
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Joseph Milanowycz reached his son Greg by cell phone

679
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,800
Greg at that time, I could tell by his voice, was scared. He said to me:

680
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:34,800
Dad, could you get in touch with someone and tell them that there's about 20 of us on the northeast corner of the 93rd floor

681
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:44,300
Greg had been about to leave the South tower after the North Tower was attacked,

682
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,400
but was told it was safer to return to his desk

683
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,400
A couple of times he said: Why did I listen why did I listen..

684
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Who was a director in the company that provided electronic security for the World Trade Center and Washington's Dulles Airport,

685
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,500
both involved in September 11th ?

686
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,500
None other than the president's younger brother

687
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:20,000
From 1996 to 2000, Securacom installed what was referred to as a new security system at the World Trade Center

688
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Wirt D Walker III, a cousin of the Bush brothers, was CEO of Securacom from 1999 until 2002

689
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,500
Interestingly, these facts have not been made public

690
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:38,300
Was it only a security system that was added during those years,

691
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,800
or was it also the wiring for a long-awaited plan ?

692
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:49,300
Scott Forbes, an IT specialist in a firm that had leased space in the South Tower since its erection,

693
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:56,300
reported an unprecedented power down in his building for almost the whole weekend prior to 9/11

694
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:01,300
We were notified three weeks in advance of the power down by the Port Authority

695
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:08,300
That was relatively short notice to plan to shut down all of our banking systems

696
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,800
It was a big deal. It was unprecedented. We had a data center on the 97th floor, so our originating servers were all there 

697
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,800
During that weekend, the power down meant there was no security

698
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,800
The doors were all open, basically

699
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,900
And also, the security video cameras were all off

700
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:35,400
But, there were guys in overalls carrying huge toolboxes and reels of cable walking around the building on that weekend

701
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Employees were notified that Internet cables were being upgraded

702
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,900
But who were the strange workmen and what were they really doing ?

703
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,600
All the power was shut down

704
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:56,600
If there was a power down, that meant that everything was gone in terms of security,

705
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:03,600
in terms of access to the building, so anybody could have come there and done any kind of set-up

706
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,600
Having worked overtime to get his company's servers back up,

707
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,200
Scott took the day off on September 11th

708
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,300
As he watched the towers collapse from New Jersey that morning,

709
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,400
he was sure this had been the purpose of the mysterious weekend work

710
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,400
Scott notified many authorities, including the 9/11 Commission,

711
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,100
about the unusual and lengthy power outage,

712
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,700
but was ignored

713
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:40,700
Ben Fountain of Fireman's Fund spoke of unusual evacuations ordered at the Twin Towers during the weeks before September 11th

714
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:47,700
Others reported that the security alert was inexplicably lifted five days prior,

715
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,800
and bomb-sniffing dogs were removed

716
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
What would the dogs have discovered had they remained on duty ?

717
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,700
Urban renewal

718
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:08,200
Not long after the disaster, Lower Manhattan saw banners like this one

719
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,600
Although they were idolized as cathedral-like symbols of power and triumph that pierced the New York skyline,

720
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:22,200
the Twin Towers were big money-losers for the Port Authority of New York

721
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:26,700
They cost millions a year to equip with the basics:

722
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,800
electricity, water, heat, air-conditioning, sewage

723
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,900
and even oxygen - being airtight

724
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,400
As modern communications connected traders from all corners of the globe,

725
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:43,000
tenancy in the Twin Towers continued to drop

726
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,500
The towers presented another problem

727
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,400
Decades ago, their steel beams had been sprayed with fireproof asbestos

728
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:58,500
a cancer-causing material banned from use in building in the mid-1980s

729
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:03,300
Although the World Trade Center complex was given several waivers,

730
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,400
it was expected to clean up its act

731
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:12,900
But to remove the asbestos from every supporting beam in the Twin Towers would have been almost undoable

732
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,400
Quotes for this clean-up ran over a billion,

733
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,500
and no insurance company was willing to bear the cost

734
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,500
An urban renewal project of unfathomable proportions

735
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,500
Given the towers' issues and problems, September 11th proved an unexpected bonanza

736
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:37,100
The Trade Center was built in the 1960s to revive a rundown area of New York,

737
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,600
and 40 years later urban renewal could again take place

738
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,600
Two white elephants were removed, and a brand-new complex is in the works

739
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,600
The full height of the new Freedom Tower will soar to 1776 feet (533 m)

740
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:07,100
The suffocating dust that engulfed Manhattan was much more than dust

741
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:13,300
It was pulverized concrete, glass, metals, containing lead, mercury, dioxins, benzene,

742
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,400
and, of course, asbestos

743
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,900
None of that was healthy for any living thing

744
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,300
Today, thousands of rescue workers have developed lung cancer

745
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,400
and serious, permanent health conditions

746
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,400
And the rescue dogs continue to die

747
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,400
What you had was a ground-level municipal incinerator that smoldered for months

748
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:43,500
burning up the most heavily computerized building in the world

749
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,500
Patients have had black paste coming out of their pores

750
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:55,700
They have reported bowel movements that are blue or green, and have smelled like smoke,

751
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,800
despite the fact that they have not been at a fire scene for months

752
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,800
Only three days after September 11th, Washington instructed the EPA

753
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,400
to declare Manhattan safe and re-open Wall Street,

754
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,500
though the air remained toxic

755
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
A federal judge is blasting former head of the Environmental Protection Agency

756
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:21,100
for telling New Yorkers it was safe to return to their homes and offices near Ground Zero

757
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,300
soon after the 9/11 attacks

758
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,400
The judge called Christine Todd Whitman's actions "conscious shocking" and refuse to grant her immunity

759
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:34,100
It was documented that the White House ordered EPA to tell these lies,

760
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:39,200
to downplay the seriousness of the environmental hazards

761
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:45,200
In addition, 911 first responders who have fallen ill and applied for aid,

762
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,800
have been denied

763
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,800
Licorice steel

764
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,800
Asbestos plays a part in the myth of why the Twin Towers fell on September 11th

765
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:04,500
[Official story] The steel had been sprayed with lightweight fireproof foam which,

766
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,600
while cheaper, was much less adhesive

767
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,400
The New York Times has reported that the foam fell off easily,

768
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:16,900
and the Port Authority had been fixing and replacing missing sections in the months before September 11th

769
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,900
But even if the fireproofing had been perfectly applied,

770
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
the impact of the plane crashing into the North Tower was so powerful, it simply blew most of it off,

771
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,300
allowing the fire to attack the steel beneath

772
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,800
Once the planes hit, whatever condition it was in before the fact made no difference

773
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,400
because an impact would knock it off,

774
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,000
and the fire would have devastating effects on the steel

775
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,100
James Glanz, New York Times

776
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:50,100
One good smack from a jet plane and the puffs of asbestos are all blown off the steel

777
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,600
Would a few hundred doors slamming do the same thing ?

778
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:59,100
Here, the History Channel tells us how, due to poor fireproofing,

779
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,700
flames swept through the pockets between floors

780
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:08,900
[Official story] As much of the fireproofing had been dislodged on impact, the flames were attacking unprotected steel

781
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:15,900
When steel is not protected the strength reduces very fast

782
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,900
When you get to about 1100°F (600°C), you lose about half the strength of the steel

783
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:31,900
The fire inside the Towers may have reached 2500°F/1370°C (in reality max. 1200°F/650°C)

784
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
New York Times has reported what happened to those steel floor trusses then

785
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
The steed did heat up and became softer and softer, almost like liquish

786
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,000
And eventually all the steel had been weakened in this zone

787
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:57,200
40 years ago, the steel used to build the World Trade Center was certified by Underwriters Laboratories,

788
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,700
a global product-compliance and public-safety guardian

789
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,900
Let's hear a lone voice that spoke out from this enormous company

790
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,400
My name is Kevin Ryan and I was formerly a manager at Underwriters Laboratories

791
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:19,000
I was fired from my job five days after sending a letter to a government scientist at the NIST,

792
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,100
questioning the report that the NIST had recently released in October of 2004

793
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:29,100
I wrote this letter because I had serious questions about what I saw in the report

794
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:36,100
Those questions went back to September of 2001 when UL's CEO came to our location in South Bend

795
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:45,600
He told our entire staff the World Trade Center steel had been certified by UL, and he said that we should be proud of how long the buildings had stood

796
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:53,100
Over the next two years, I did some research and found some very disturbing facts,

797
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,300
including that the steel had been disposed of in an unprecedented manner

798
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:03,500
Once I discovered those facts, I sent a written question the UL's CEO asking him about these things

799
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,600
and what he was doing to protect our reputation as a company

800
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,700
He replied in writing to me that UL did, in fact, test the steel

801
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,800
He talked about the quality of the sample and how well it had performed in the tests,

802
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:20,400
and he said that our company had tested the steel, and it had done beautifully

803
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,200
After that, he asked me to be patient and wait for the NIST report because UL was working closely with them

804
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:32,700
I saw this report in October of 2004, and in November I sent my letter to NIST

805
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,800
asking for clarification

806
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,800
I felt it was an obligation on my part to ask the questions

807
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,900
since no one else seemed to care to

808
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:47,400
After the 1993 bombing, the fireproofing in both buildings was updated considerably

809
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:52,000
But when you look at the NIST report, you don't see any testing

810
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:59,600
that showed that a 767 would widely dislodge the fireproofing under any impact, let alone so far from the point of impact

811
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:07,400
So now we've been left with a new theory, which is not really a theory at all, but only a collection of vague statements

812
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:13,700
The NIST report represents what can really only be called anti-science

813
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,800
They started with their conclusions, and worked their way back to some leading hypothesis

814
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:23,400
When the results of the physical tests showed the temperatures were far too low to soften steel,

815
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:29,500
and that the floors could not have collapsed, and that the fireproofing could not have been widely dislodged,

816
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,600
the NIST ignored these results and built a black-box computer model that no one could argue with

817
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,900
and that they know would spit out the right answers

818
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,700
Today anyone who's conscious enough to know what is happening in the world knows

819
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,800
that most government policy is being driven by this false story

820
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,600
..track down and punish the perpetrators of this attack

821
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,700
This is being seen on Capital Hill as another Pearl Harbor

822
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,500
The steel, in dragon-like lengths and contortions, spoke for itself

823
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,700
Bent, deformed, without cracks

824
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,800
8 tons H-beam

825
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,800
I found it hard to believe that it actually bent because of the size of it

826
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,900
and how there's no cracks in the iron

827
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
It bent without almost a single crack in it

828
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,600
It takes thousands of degrees to bend steel like this

829
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,700
Typically you'd have buckling and tearing on the tension side,

830
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,800
but there's on buckling at all

831
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,800
Here is the meteorite

832
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,900
molten iron fused with concrete

833
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:40,900
Architects, engineers, people who work with steel, welders,

834
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,500
have just have never seen the level of destruction and the level of deformation of this material in our lives

835
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
It is true that heat expands steel

836
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:57,300
In a fire, steel members may swell and bend slightly

837
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:03,300
But this ? How could these huge tangles have been created ?

838
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,600
The steel below the towers had melted, at many thousands of degrees

839
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:14,200
Since metal conducts heat, were these twisted remains formed

840
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:18,800
by high temperatures wicking their way through a gridwork of steel ?

841
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,800
Steel deformation by heat

842
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,200
Explosives also deform steel

843
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,500
As they fire, gas pushes outward

844
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,600
The force of the gas can easily bend a large steel column

845
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,100
Two kinds of debris

846
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,700
Huge shattered columns that could break a truck,

847
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,800
combined with matter that was near pulverized

848
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,300
You have two 110-story office buildings

849
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,800
You don't find a desk, you don't find a chair, you don't find a telephone, a computer

850
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,800
The biggest piece of a telephone I found was half of the keypad, and it was about this big

851
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,800
In 1886, four gold miners lost their lives in an underground explosion

852
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:18,900
The bodies of these four men were brought to the surface in one barrel

853
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,900
The biggest piece recovered was part of a foot

854
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:31,400
September 11th left over 1100 bodies unaccounted for

855
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:38,900
At Ground Zero, this was found inside a length of steel

856
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:44,900
Before they seal it, workers would sometimes put there beer cans,

857
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,000
or newspaper, we found New York Times in a similar spot to this

858
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Lingering questions

859
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Secrets cannot be kept forever

860
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:11,200
Just as that newspaper from 1969 revealed itself to us decades later,

861
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:15,300
we will someday know the inside of September 11th

862
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:20,300
The reasons for the staging of such a production go far back into time

863
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,500
Insurance policies covered nearly everything in the World Trade Center that was destroyed

864
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,500
But what if certain commodities could be removed in the nick of time ?

865
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:41,500
Gold and silver held by commercial banks and the Comex exchange is said to have been stored beneath Ground Zero

866
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:49,500
This single cache, belonging to the Bank of Nova Scotia, was unearthed and made public

867
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:55,500
Was there more, and was it removed, remains a question

868
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:02,200
As Last Survivor William Rodriguez climbed the stairwell to rescue people,

869
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,300
he remembers a very strange thing

870
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:10,700
As I stood there on the 33rd floor, I heard very strange noises on the 34th floor

871
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,800
Now the 34th floor was an empty floor. A floor that did not have any kind of walls

872
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:21,900
It was a construction floor it was totally hollowed out, there was nothing there

873
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:26,900
and I heard very heavy equipment being moved around,

874
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:32,900
and it sounded like dumpsters with metal wheels being moved around and

875
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I got scared because I knew it was an empty floor nobody was supposed to be there

876
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,600
As a matter of fact, not even the elevator stopped there

877
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:48,200
You have to have a special access key to open the door on the 34th floor,

878
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:53,500
so to find that there was strange noises there, I continued actually bypassing that floor

879
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,100
because I didn't dare to open the door on the 34th floor

880
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,500
Something told William Rodriguez not to mess with the 34th floor

881
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,600
I got scared

882
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:08,200
Yet William Rodriguez was not a man who was scared that day

883
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,800
He remained in a burning building against firemen's orders,

884
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:16,900
endangering his own life as he saved the lives of others

885
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
What could have been happening on the 34th floor ?

886
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,600
For weeks, Scott Forbes had heard similar noises on the 98th floor above him

887
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:30,200
It must have been at least four to six weeks before 9/11

888
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:34,800
It was like rebuilding work going on upstairs

889
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,900
The tenants, the people from Aon who had been there, were moved somewhere else

890
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,500
The offices were just vacant,

891
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,600
and there was a lot of heavy machinery building work going on

892
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:50,700
It was almost like pneumatic drills and lots of hammering

893
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,800
So much so that the floors were shaking, that's how noticeable it was

894
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:59,900
It was almost as if something heavy was being moved, and then it was being taken off wheels, and it was like, BOOM!

895
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Our floor underneath literally shook

896
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:07,100
You could feel the weight above you. That was how large it was

897
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:11,300
On one occasion I opened a door to see what was going on, being nosey

898
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,400
When I opened the door the whole office space was empty

899
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:20,000
There was nothing there at all. It was quite bizarre

900
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,100
because it was just empty, completely empty, barren, nothing, zero

901
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,900
Not even cables hanging from the ceiling

902
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,800
But there'd been these heavy noises and vibrations up above

903
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,500
It was really strange

904
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:35,500
And the noticeable dust in the building the week before

905
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,500
It was probably the week leading up to 9/11

906
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,600
Every morning I'd come in around 7a.m., and the dust was incredible! 

907
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:50,100
It was filthy. I was like the cleaners weren't cleaning. Right were the windows were, there was a sill which enclosed radiators

908
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:55,200
I was sick to death of the dust which was appearing on the window sills 

909
01:22:55,300 --> 01:23:01,300
It was dirty gray and very, very noticeable in that week leading up to 9/11

910
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,900
Where was that dust coming from ?

911
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,700
Gray dust Scott himself had to clean

912
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,200
Was it powdered cement ?

913
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:16,500
The steel columns of the Twin Towers formed an endo and exo-skeleton

914
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Had something been placed around the edge of the building, 

915
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:23,100
holes been drilled to contain it ?

916
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,600
Was the dust in those final days a telltale sign ?

917
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,200
As white elephants, the buildings were full of vacant offices

918
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:38,300
Tenants could be temporarily moved around for upgrades as Aon was, and a plan arranged to perfection

919
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:44,800
Was the strange construction that could be heard but not seen

920
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,900
going on all over the towers ?

921
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:54,400
Larry Silverstein took possession 6 weeks before September 11th, when the strange construction began

922
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:03,600
Were the sounds that scared William Rodriguez the last of the rats as they left a sinking ship ?

923
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,600
By taking a day off, Scott Forbes saved his life

924
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:18,100
This woman was not so fortunate

925
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:22,300
Calling soundlessly to people who could not help her,.. she was sacrificed on 9/11

926
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:29,300
Christopher Hanley, trapped with 100 people on the 106th floor of Tower 1

927
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,400
Fire Department 408 Where's the fire ?

928
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:37,500
Yeah hi, I'm on the 106th floor of the World Trade Center. We just had an explosion up here

929
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,500
Yeah, there's smoke and we have about a 100 people up here

930
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,800
Sit tight Do not leave, okay ? There's a fire or an explosion or something in the building

931
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:50,100
All right, I want you to stay where you are

932
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:50,900
Yes

933
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,400
Kevin Cosgrove, trapped on the 105th floor of the South Tower

934
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,900
Smoke – real bad – 105, Two Tower

935
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,900
It's really bad, it's black, it's arid

936
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,300
My wife thinks I'm all right I called and said I was leaving the building, I was fine,

937
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,400
and then - BANG!

938
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:16,500
Three of us – two broken windows

939
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Oh, God!

940
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Let's not forget these people, whose fate on this day was decided for them

941
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
As we know, secrets cannot be kept forever

942
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Postscript

943
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,000
There are perhaps a dozen blasting companies that handle the world's major demolitions

944
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Family-owned and widely respected, their knowledge is derived from experience

945
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,100
and the materials they use are conventional 

946
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,100
WTC demolitions where highly advanced and unconventional

947
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:15,800
Explosives have always been the domain of the military, and what took place at Ground Zero

948
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,500
is not even fully understood by civilian blasters

949
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:28,500
The destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7 was conducted in broad light, in a full view of news cameras and reporters,

950
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:33,600
thousands of New Yorkers, and millions who watched on live TV

951
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,600
Shock and awe

952
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,600
Fearing worse and ignorant of scientific principles, the public mind was readily manipulated

953
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:52,600
This film was made to present possibilities and raise questions. We do not have control over our airwaves

954
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:58,700
We have consigned them to large corporations who create scripted sounds bites serving as "news"

955
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:10,700
911 Mysteries gives you what the airwaves have failed to

956
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:17,800
The footage used is in some cases authorized, in other cases not, borrowed within the realm of Fair Use Doctrine and U.S. Copyright Code section 107

958
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:32,800
911 Mysteries is offered in a spirit of the American Constitution as an alternative analysis

959
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:37,900
and invitation for dialogue, a tool for awareness in the interest of public good

960
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,900
Ask questions. Think for yourself

961
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,900
Wake up, and you will make the difference

962
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:37,900
911 is a Keyhole to consciousness, if you can get through it to the other side, everything looks different

963
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Don't be afraid

964
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:46,100
This is First Awakening. Follow your curiosity, like Alice in the rabbit hole. You are becoming free

965
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:04,100
Keep stepping forward. Share your discoveries.

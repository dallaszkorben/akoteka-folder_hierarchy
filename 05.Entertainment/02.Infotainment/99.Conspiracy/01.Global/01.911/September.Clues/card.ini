[storyline]
orig = The so-called 'terror-attack' of 9/11 was nothing but a psyop or, in other words, a gigantic make-believe simulation.\n\nIt was pulled off with the active support of the mainstream newsmedia - and their complicity continues to this day. The entire World Trade Center complex - 9 buildings in all - was of course demolished (in bright daylight - hidden behind a smokescreen ) but what we saw on TV was nothing but a prefabricated 'Hollywood' movie.\n\nNo planes were involved (thus no passengers died) - and no people were killed in the (empty) twin towers. For the perpetrators to kill 3000 white collar workers in New York City would have been the silliest self-inflicted aggravation imaginable.\n\nNow, all this may come as a shock to many people. However, the evidence is overwhelming and has been consolidated by the steady efforts of independent researchers from all over the world - who have nothing to gain from spreading false information.\n\nUltimately, it is up to every open-minded individual to look at the available evidence for him/herself. However, please keep in mind that most 'conspiracy theories' you may have bumped into (such as Michael Moore's blockbuster Fahrenheit 9/11 and the internet blockbuster Loose Change) were created to uphold our illusion of living in a world graced with freedom of speech.

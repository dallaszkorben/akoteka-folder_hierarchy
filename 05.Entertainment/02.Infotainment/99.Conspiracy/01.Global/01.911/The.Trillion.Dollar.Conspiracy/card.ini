[storyline]
orig = Itâ€™s been more than 15 years since America experienced one of the biggest and greatest terrorist attacks on its soil. And there are still conspiracies trying to shed some light on what happened on September 11, 2001.\n\nIt was a Tuesday morning, and nobody expected such disaster to happen. But shortly after the morning, news surfaced that the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda hijacked four airliners and carried out suicide attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. There were hundreds of victims, and thousands of injured.\n\nThe 9/11 attack was one of the best coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group. America responded by starting a war on terrorism. But more than 15 years later, and there are still unanswered questions. Every new conspiracy theory video tries to find an answer to a different question.\n\nOne of the most important, and often discussed questions is whether the hit was actually supported by the American government. Find out in this conspiracy documentary.

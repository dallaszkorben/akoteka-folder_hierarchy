orig = Retired Major General Albert N. Stubblebine became the biggest name to disagree with the official version of events a few years ago.\n\nVideo interview 6/28/09:\n\nGeneral Stubblebine: I am Major General Albert Stubblebine. I am retired Army Major-General. In my last assignment — my last command — I was responsible for all of the Army’s strategic intelligence forces around the world. I had responsibility for the Signals Intelligence, Photo Intelligence, Counter Intelligence, Human Intelligence. They all belonged to me, in my last assignment.\n\nOn September 11 2001, two planes ploughed into New York City’s Twin Towers and another jumbo jet smashed into the Pentagon – the headquarters of the US Department of Defense. Well Major General Stubblebine didn't believe half of it. The top brass, who was US Army’s Intelligence and Security Command from 1981 to 1984, went on the record to say that he believed his country’s government was lying.\n\nIn an interview, the ex-top military brass, 86, said he carefully examined the partly-destroyed Pentagon in the aftermath of the attack and changed his mind about what happened. He said: “I was so ingrained in my belief system that I could not believe – literally could not believe – that anybody but an Arab terrorist could do something like that.\n\n“And then one day I saw a picture – it was a photograph of the Pentagon and the hole in the Pentagon. “And I looked at it again and I said, ‘something’s wrong, something’s wrong with this picture’.” He claimed that the more he studied it, he realised something didn’t quite add up in his head.\n\nMajor General Stubblebine said that after investigation – including measuring the impact site with the size of the jet – it couldn’t have been a plane that hit. Instead, he concluded it was a missile that smashed in the landmark, citing “evidence” that the remnants of a turbine from a rocket were left in the impact zone. He said in the same interview that images that allegedly back up his incredible claims were swiftly removed from the internet and replaced with doctored pictures.\n\nSince he went public with his theory, he added that he supported the much-debated idea that the Twin Towers were brought down in a controlled demolition. Just last year, a number of engineers came forward to say they supported the conspiracy that a fire could not have caused the buildings to collapse.\n\nMajor General Stubblebine’s shocking claims have reemerged online in the same week an ex-Navy boss said a timeline of the September 11 attacks should be taught to kids in school.Lord West of Spithead said educators should tell youngsters what happened 15 years ago because of the sheer number of “worrying” conspiracies online. He told The Times: “Anyone under 19 will have no memory of the September 11 attacks. They will know about it only if they’ve gone online and looked at websites, or been taught about it.\n\n“There are theories saying the US did it and I find this really worrying. Lots of people online are actively blaming everything in Iraq and Syria on the West.”\n\nMajor General Albert "Bert" Newton Stubblebine III, who has died on his 87th birthday, February 6, 2017, was head of US Army Intelligence in the early 1980s; he was nicknamed “spoonbender” for his belief in the use of psychic and telepathic powers in warfare that was later evoked in Grant Heslov’s film The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009), starring George Clooney as a Special Forces operative who trains “psychic spies”.\n\nThanks to, Kate Levi www.discerningkate.com

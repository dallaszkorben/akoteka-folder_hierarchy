[storyline]
orig = At the end of World War I, Hitler makes his way to the politically charged city of Munich, where he joins a fringe group and begins to transform it into the Nazi Party. After recruiting Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, and others to the cause, he readies his "Brownshirts" for his all-or-nothing bid to seize power by putsch.

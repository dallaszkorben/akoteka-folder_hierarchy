[storyline]
orig = After invading Russia in June 1941, Hitler makes his biggest error of the war in the wake of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The Nazis suffer a series of reverses at Stalingrad, in North Africa and Italy, and in the round-the-clock bombing of their cities by U.S. and British air forces. No amount of Goebbels's propaganda can convince Germans they are still winning.

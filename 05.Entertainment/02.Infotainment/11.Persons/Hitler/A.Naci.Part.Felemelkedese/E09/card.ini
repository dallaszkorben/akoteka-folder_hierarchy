[storyline]
orig = With the Red Army closing in on Berlin, Hitler is a wreck of a man: prematurely aged, pill-dependent, losing touch with reality, and determined to fight to the end. Nazi ringleaders maneuver to save themselves and cut their own deals with the Allies. The inner circle gathers for one last time to celebrate the führer's 56th birthday, days after which he arrives at his own final solution.

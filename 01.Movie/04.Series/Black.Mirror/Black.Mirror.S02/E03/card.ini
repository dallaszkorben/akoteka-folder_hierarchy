[storyline]
storyline_en = Comedian Jamie Slater provides the voice for Waldo, a blue cartoon bear who interviews politicians for a late night topical satire show where Waldo generally humiliates them. Jamie's producer Jack Napier suggests Waldo stands as the local MP in the upcoming election, against pompous Tory boy Liam Monroe - one of Waldo's interview victims. A reluctant Jamie agrees and meets the Labour candidate Gwendolyn, with whom he has a one night stand but is later told to keep away from by her campaign manager. On a televised discussion show Jamie sounds off against all the opposition, claiming they are insincere, and he becomes hugely popular as a result. However he suffers from guilt and urges people not to vote for Waldo. After Napier orchestrates an attack on him Jamie wakes in hospital to see the election results. Has Waldo won and if so will his success take Jamie with it?
storyline_hu = Jamie Salter (Daniel Rigby) egy szebb napokat látott komikus, akinek szatirikus szkeccse a politikailag inkorrekt animált kék medvéről, Waldóról egyre népszerűbb lesz. Amikor Waldo önálló sorozatot kap, a műsor producere (Jason Flemyng) nyomására Waldo jelölteti magát egy időközi választáson, ahol a munkáspárti Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie) és a tory Liam Monroe (Tobias Menzies) az ellenfelei.

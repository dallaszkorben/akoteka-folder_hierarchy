[storyline]
orig = Dennis Dimbleby Bagley is a brilliant young advertising executive who can't come up with a slogan to sell a revolutionary new pimple cream. His obsessive worrying affects not only his relationship with his wife, his friends and his boss, but also his own body - graphically demonstrated when he grows a large stress-related boil on his shoulder. But when the boil grows eyes and a mouth and starts talking, Bagley really begins to think he's lost his mind. But has he?
en = 
hu = Denis Dimbleby, a lehetetlent nem ismerő, sikert sikerre halmozó reklámguru egy nap rájön, hogy képtelen frappáns ötlettel előállni egy új, pattanás elleni krém eladási szlogenjére. Az alkotói válság annyira elhatalmasodik a férfin, hogy az már feleségével, barátaival és főnökével való kapcsolatát is megterheli.

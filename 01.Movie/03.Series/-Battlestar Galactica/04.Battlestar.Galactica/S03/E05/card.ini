[storyline]
orig = Now safely back in the fleet, those who managed to escape from New Caprica are seeking revenge against those they believe collaborated with the Cylons. Six of them, including Chief Tyrol and Col. Tigh, have formed the Circle and are acting as judge, jury and executioner. Those found guilty are blown out of an airlock. Lee Adama has noted that in the three days since everyone was reunited, 13 people have simply disappeared without a trace. The morale aboard the Galactica is not good with perceived collaborators being shunned by the others. Among those in that situation is Felix Gaeta who, as Gaius Baltar's Chief of Staff, is high on the Circle's list. As for Baltar is now being kept aboard a Cylon Basestar and his captors are deciding his fate as well.
en = 
hu = Tyrol is részt vesz abban a titkos törvényhozásban, amely a Galaktikán történik és azokat az embereket ítélik el, akik a Cylonok-kal vélhetően együttműködtek. Tyrol lelkiismerete azonban nem bírja sokáig és éppen jókor, hiszen majdnem egy ártatlan embert ölnek meg. Baltarnak eközben egy Cylon esküdtszékkel kell szembenéznie, akik el fogják dönteni, hogy a hajójukon maradhat-e, vagy meg kell halnia.

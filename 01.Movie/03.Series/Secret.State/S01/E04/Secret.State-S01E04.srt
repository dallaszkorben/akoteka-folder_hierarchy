14
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,359
In other news this morning,

15
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,799
the markets have responded positively
to the Prime Minister's announcement

16
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,519
that the Indian government
will underwrite sterling.

17
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,799
The pound rallied,

18
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,919
gaining more than two pence
against the US dollar.

19
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,359
This could be construed as a personal
success for Tom Dawkins,

20
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,399
although he has been criticised by
environmental campaigners

21
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,399
for reneging on existing
international agreements.

22
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,519
All right, ladies and gents.
Thank you. Stand back.

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,799
Behind the tape. Thank you.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,039
I'll be right back.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,399
Well? What do you know?

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,399
A burglary, perhaps.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,319
Signs of a struggle.

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,319
Someone's been tearing the place
apart looking for bugs, or...

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,439
..removing them.

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,399
Was he bugged?

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,679
If he was, I didn't know about
it and it wasn't by us.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,399
Then by who?

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,399
It may have been another agency
targeting me through him.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,159
Hoping he'd be...

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,679
indiscreet.

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,519
About...Nightlight?

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,079
'Nightlight was a fuck-up,
Tom.

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,479
'And it was my fault, as I'm
sure you know.'

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,479
Some people think it led to the death
of an MI6 officer the following year.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,719
Now, they are wrong, but...

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,719
Jesus Christ.

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,399
They wouldn't have gone this
far, not for that.

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,119
The bugging, maybe, but not
this.

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,719
Then what?

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,719
'It could be this photo
he died for.

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,559
'Did you give it to him?'

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,719
Is that his blood?

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,119
We think it's from one of Syed Khan's
picture messages.

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,839
So you didn't give it to him?

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,439
No.

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,439
'If not you, then who?'

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,639
We may have a problem.

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,479
The Times called. This is what
they'll be running tomorrow.

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,479
Tom served in the British Army in
Bosnia with the UN. Peacekeeping.

55
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,079
Now, according to this article,
he crossed into an area he
shouldn't have been

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,519
and he broke UN rules of
engagement

57
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,039
to free an Army translator taken
prisoner by an armed gang.

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,079
What's wrong with that?

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,639
The translator was killed,
plus three other civilians

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,479
and a member of Tom's
company.Civilians?

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,999
You said it was an armed gang.
Criminals. Not combatants.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,919
Well, in my book, that's
heroism, not a war crime.

63
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,599
Well, he covered it up.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,239
It's bad judgment then,
bad judgment now.

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,399
Felix, you just don't like it that
he actually does something.

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,159
He's acting like some crazed
Marxist!Championing small
businesses? Marxism?

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,479
Nationalising a bank?!

68
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,159
Bringing PetroFex to book and
standing up for the people of
Scarrow.

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,879
Shooting civilians?

70
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,879
Are they saying that?

71
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,559
I've just told you
everything I know.

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,559
Someone needs to speak to Tom.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,599
Ros...

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,639
It's you or me, isn't it?I'm sorry?

75
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,799
When he goes. Tom. If.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,559
I've done a poll.

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,359
He's swimming against the tide.

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,999
He's not happy.

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,519
Get Ellis Kane here. Now.

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,679
You see why I didn't want to stand.

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,319
Because the story would get out.

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,839
It's a distraction, Tom.
Nothing more.

83
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,839
Show you're vulnerable on this and
the Government will suffer.

84
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,839
Shrug it off, move on.

85
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,839
That's leadership.

86
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,599
Did you shoot civilians?

87
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,599
No. No.

88
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,039
So, it was a mistake, 20 years
ago. Doesn't mean you're
making a mistake now.

89
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,479
A mistake? It was a bloody mess.

90
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,959
So move on. Tony Fossett is dead.

91
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,759
We're sleepwalking into a war
with Iran.

92
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,639
The whole thing is starting again!

93
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,159
You stepped up, Tom, when the
country needed you.

94
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,159
You're in the firing line. That's
your job. It was then and it is now.

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,759
We don't know what happened
to Tony Fossett.

96
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,319
What I can tell you is,

97
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,319
he wouldn't want you
crying in the lavatory.

98
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,799
He'd want you out there,
making waves.

99
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,639
It might have been an idea to tell me
about the skeleton in your cupboard.

100
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,079
Are you telling me you didn't know?

101
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,079
Of course I didn't know.

102
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,519
And I recall giving you some
advice about Ellis Kane.

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,079
But I didn't say anything to her.

104
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,079
So where could it have come from?

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,799
They are big, rough lads at
the MoD, Tom.

106
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,599
And they've had a very hard
time from Government lately.

107
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,479
They've lost their Nimrod
fleet, their aircraft carriers,

108
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,879
they've had budgets and
troop numbers cut to ribbons.

109
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,839
If they're starting to feel
a little bit unmanned...

110
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,839
they'd be more than capable of
feeding a smear story to a
well-placed journalist.

111
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,679
Ellis Kane's here.

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,479
Tell me he's joking.

113
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,919
Are you going to tell me what the
fuck you think you're playing at?

114
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,119
Are you going to pretend
I didn't give you a chance

115
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,839
to give me your side of the story?

116
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,039
And why would I do that?Yeah.

117
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,359
Why would a journalist want to help?

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,319
You can't sit

119
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,999
on festering secrets like that and
then hope to take on the world.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,759
I bloody...I told you something
was out there.

121
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,799
I asked you to give me
your side of the story.

122
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,159
You said, "There's nothing there.
There's nothing to give."

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,039
Well, fuck you, Tom Dawkins.

124
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,479
You're not the only one trying to
find their way in the world.

125
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,999
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,919
Oh, fuck off!
The great hotshot journalist

127
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,399
too big for your own story, and now
nobody wants to speak to you.

128
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,519
Is that what I am?

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,879
That's what people say to me
all the time.

130
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,079
Then what are you?

131
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,079
I'm the fucking Prime Minister!

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,319
I received an anonymous email.

133
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,319
A report you'd written about an
unsanctioned mission

134
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,639
to rescue your translator from
Bosnia.

135
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,479
You entered an area
barred to the British Army...

136
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,399
..and five people ended up
dead in the firefight,

137
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,159
including the translator and the man
you took with you,

138
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,359
Corporal Aiden Farlowe.

139
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,959
You redacted the report.

140
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,759
I allowed myself to be persuaded to
redact that report.

141
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,719
You do a thing like that...

142
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,719
..supposedly for the best.
Oh.

143
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,999
You act on advice.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,999
You try to persuade yourself
that it's for the greater good.

145
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,079
And you also know that it's going to
save your arse.

146
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,879
And it dogs you.

147
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,399
It dogs you from that day to this.

148
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,279
You were rescuing your translator.

149
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,279
I was sleeping with her.

150
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,399
Ah.

151
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,479
Thought you'd gone.

152
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,999
I'm going.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,519
You mustn't take it personally.

154
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,479
I've had targets die. It's hard.

155
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,519
But they never knew you -
don't forget that.

156
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,519
And you never knew them.

157
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,759
I think I need to take some
time off.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,999
The people on those lists...
are there for a reason.

159
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,839
It's our job...

160
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,919
to monitor them.

161
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,919
No more than that.

162
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,759
Take a couple of days.

163
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,759
Somebody fucked up.
Other than you, you mean?

164
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,359
Fossett was Dawkins' closest
friend.

165
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,359
And the black box.
What's happening with that?

166
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,959
Forget about the flight recorder.

167
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,599
It's never coming back.

168
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,479
And...

169
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,159
once they've seen that,

170
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,159
no-one will ask about it again.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,999
Nothing dodgy about this dossier.

172
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,679
Happy now?

173
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,439
Fossett had some of this
information?

174
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,479
Where did he get hold of it?

175
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,479
We're presuming Dawkins.

176
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,559
I'll call you.

177
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,799
Give me a secure line to GCHQ.

178
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,439
Hello!

179
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,439
Um, yeah, that's right. She does.

180
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,519
Right.

181
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,639
'Excuse me, Prime Minister.

182
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,239
'You don't know me, but my name is
Agnes Evans...'

183
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,239
Go through the Press Office
like everybody else.

184
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,279
The Iranians
have interned 30 UK nationals.

185
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,919
They're describing them as spies,
which is ludicrous.

186
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,199
What are they?

187
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,759
All the oil companies
keep a skeleton staff in Iran

188
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,719
for the day
when sanctions are lifted.

189
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,679
So they're oil men?

190
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,119
So they're oil men?
UN sanctions forbid Western oil
companies from operating in Iran,

191
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,159
so, suddenly,
the Iranians are saying

192
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,439
they must be there
under false pretences.

193
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,039
Hard-liners banging the drum
pre-election.

194
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,599
They know their time
is running out.

195
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,039
They're not the only ones.

196
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,359
They want us to jump
up and down, make threats

197
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,359
and behave like the warmongering
imperialists they've cast us as.

198
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,999
I suppose they do, yes.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,319
To which our answer
should be what?

200
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,119
I know what you want me to say,
Tom.

201
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,919
You want me to say, "Violins
and camomile tea," but I'm not...

202
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,879
You're not going to start telling me
how the world works, are you, Ros?

203
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,759
Then stop trying to reinvent it
at our expense!

204
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,679
And if you're going to sell
the family silver to the Indians,

205
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,399
consult the bloody
Foreign Secretary!

206
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,799
Or even the Chancellor!

207
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,999
There's a consensus
growing out there

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,559
that you're going to burn bright,
but brief.

209
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,559
And you need to make
a decision about Iran.

210
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,439
There are 312 MPs
in this party.

211
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,439
And they've delegated us
to make the decisions that matter.

212
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,959
What are you saying, Felix?

213
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,559
Felix isn't saying anything.

214
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,559
Are you, Felix?

215
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,559
Thank you, John.

216
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,999
I needed your support
on that one.

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,879
And that doesn't worry you?

218
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,879
Mm.

219
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,319
Sami Sharour visited Tehran
on at least a dozen occasions

220
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,759
in the last three years.

221
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,719
He was also seen visiting
this mosque.

222
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,679
Now, the imams there are known

223
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,039
for their particularly
anti-Western stance.

224
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,039
The, er, guy on the right is very
close to the Iranian leadership.

225
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,839
A madrasah in New York
known for its radical views.

226
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,239
He visited it several times
in 2011.

227
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,879
And you think this Sharour
was on Charles's plane?

228
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,439
Oh, we're certain of it.

229
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,439
Despite the fact that he wasn't
on the passenger manifest?

230
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,279
The plane was owned by PetroFex.
He worked for the company.

231
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,079
As I understand it, he was
a late addition, like Charles Flyte.

232
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,239
If he wasn't on
the passenger manifest...

233
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,159
That's him there.

234
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,999
On the picture
that Syed Khan took.

235
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,279
Who's had access
to these pictures?

236
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,079
Well, only one has been made public.

237
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,679
And why the hell
is this only coming out now?

238
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,519
The company are cagey
about his presence there

239
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,599
because of his connection
with the drone fuel team.

240
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,879
Which was what?

241
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,519
He headed it up.

242
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,239
Now, the circumstances of
the crash...

243
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,119
With so little information
emerging,

244
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,159
it has taken a little bit longer
than we'd hoped.

245
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,599
How long have you known?

246
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,519
Well, we've been following
several different leads.

247
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,559
It has taken a while, I know...

248
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,239
You're suggesting that he was

249
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,799
somehow an agent
of the Iranian government.

250
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,799
Now, his family originated
in Syria.

251
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,119
Sharour was born there,
grew up in the US,

252
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,279
but they've retained
very close links with Iran,

253
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,879
Sami in particular.

254
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,359
It does look as though,

255
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,519
given an opportunity
to harm the Prime Minister,

256
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,519
he took it.

257
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,679
This will tip us into war.

258
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,319
We have to keep control
of the details

259
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,359
until we're absolutely certain
of the facts.

260
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,759
Well, naturally, the Americans
are aware.

261
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,279
The agreement
on shared intelligence.

262
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,279
I don't recall anybody
adhering to that

263
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,759
when it came to the drone strike.

264
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,879
Oh... It's secure with them.

265
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,879
It better be.

266
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,439
Ros,
can you give us a moment?

267
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,159
I think the time for violins
and camomile tea may be over.

268
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,279
I saw another copy
of one of those pictures today.

269
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,599
Did you?

270
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,719
Did you?
Oh, yes, I did.

271
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,839
Covered in blood.

272
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,759
Tony Fossett's?

273
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,759
So how did he get hold of it?

274
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,759
I'll look into it.

275
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,199
Down past the newsagent's
and it's round...

276
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,479
Essentially,
the Americans are saying that...

277
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,079
that no-one could accuse you

278
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,879
of belligerence or intemperance
if you retaliated.

279
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,159
Meaning?

280
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,159
Targeted strikes against
their nuclear programme.

281
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,839
How long have we been
looking for clear justification

282
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,319
to take those facilities out?

283
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,359
But, Ros...

284
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,639
a strike like that only guarantees
the hard-liners an election victory.

285
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,479
We play right into their hands.

286
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,119
Do you know the mistake
George W made after 9/11, Tom?

287
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,079
He squandered
the world's goodwill

288
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,679
by moving out of Afghanistan
and into Iraq.

289
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,959
When the news about
Charles's assassination gets out,

290
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,239
you'll have a window of
forgiveness in your hands

291
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,719
and, to quote
the US Secretary of State,

292
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,079
it's a very powerful item

293
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,079
when paired with
some Tomahawk cruise missiles.

294
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,439
Oh, God...

295
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,799
But they're right, aren't they?

296
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,799
If Sharour's an Iranian agent
and he killed Charles...

297
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,839
..then we have to act.

298
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,479
Yes.

299
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,239
If you send cruise missiles
into Iran,

300
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,159
the Iranians
will send something back.

301
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,999
Not to us, maybe,
but almost certainly Israel.

302
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,039
And if the Israelis respond in kind,

303
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,039
you'll need the balls
to see it through.

304
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,359
Well, without
the flight recorder,

305
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,839
it comes down
to a question of judgement.

306
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,839
Yours.

307
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,199
She hasn't been able
to delete the conversation,

308
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,759
but she has done her best
to lock it up and scramble it.

309
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,079
But you can access it?

310
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,079
It'll be a first if I couldn't.

311
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,959
Who the hell is this?

312
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,919
'I can't talk now.
I need to see you.'

313
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,799
I can tell you what happened
to Tony. And to Charles Flyte.

314
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,519
'But I can't talk now.

315
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,679
'There'll be someone
monitoring this phone.'

316
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,199
Well, you're not Tony.

317
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,199
And where Tony is tonight,
he won't be doing any talking.

318
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,199
OK?

319
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,059
350 years of continuous trading
and shifting your fucking assets

320
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,579
is bringing my bank to its knees.

321
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,659
Don't blame me, Michael.

322
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,139
I run the company,
not the country.

323
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,699
Always the last to know.

324
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,699
Last to know what?

325
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,059
Look sharp, Sir Michael.

326
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,059
Room for one more inside.

327
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,299
What are you doing here?

328
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,299
Didn't you get my message?

329
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,619
I was wondering if you knew
where Tony Fossett was.

330
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,499
He's dead, love. Your guess
is as good as mine.

331
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,499
I mean...where his body is.

332
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,619
You come in here once before,
didn't you?

333
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,699
Do you know where he is?

334
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,419
He said I could trust you.

335
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,419
Tony Fossett said that?

336
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,259
He's at my cousin's place
in Southgate.

337
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,419
Gotcha.

338
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,019
I've decided
you're on my side.

339
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,019
Everyone else might have given up
on me, but I've still got, well...

340
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,659
..you.

341
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,139
Where is she now?

342
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,139
You're wondering if this
fella here, Sami Sharour...

343
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,899
Gravesend.

344
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,899
..was on the fatal flight
with our ex-Prime Minister.

345
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,619
First, Scarrow. Now Sharour.

346
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,259
Things are getting out
of hand.

347
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,459
You're the public face
of this company, Paul.

348
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,219
You're going to have
to take one for the team.

349
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,979
So this is all of you, is it?

350
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,139
You all agree with this?

351
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,139
You all agree?

352
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,539
Well, fuck the fucking lot
of you!

353
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,979
Thank you. Just a precaution.

354
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,459
I can't talk now.
I need to see you.

355
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,299
I can tell you what happened
to Tony. And to Charles Flyte.

356
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,899
At this point, she was
at Hungerford Bridge.

357
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,419
'There'll be someone
monitoring this phone.'

358
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,979
Well, you're not Tony.

359
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,339
And where Tony is tonight, he
won't be doing any talking.

360
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,499
She's not in Gravesend.

361
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,099
She dropped the phone
in a boat.

362
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,779
She's wherever Tony Fossett is.

363
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,219
So you were bugging Tony Fossett?

364
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,099
Yes.

365
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,819
Yes.
Why?

366
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,219
We're not told.

367
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,619
Trigger words?

368
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,299
Nightlight.

369
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,459
Go on.

370
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,379
I may have got him killed.

371
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,979
I'm so sorry.

372
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,179
I know he was your friend.

373
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,979
I just wanted to help him, but now...

374
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,019
How?

375
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,579
Do you know who Sami Sharour is?

376
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,299
Yes, of course.

377
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,299
I thought he was involved
in Charles Flyte's death.

378
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,739
I passed the information on to Tony.

379
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,659
Why?

380
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,659
You'd lost faith in him.

381
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,459
And you know this because...?

382
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,779
I was eavesdropping...

383
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,779
on your private conversations
with him.

384
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,859
If it was your information
that killed him,

385
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,339
then he died in vain.

386
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,779
I already knew about Sami Sharour.

387
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,539
But I was wrong.

388
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,859
It wasn't Sharour.

389
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,979
Tony saw that.

390
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,659
And I wanted you to know what he saw.

391
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,499
He said if we'd seen it,

392
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,979
others must have too.

393
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,779
What others?

394
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,699
They've come for me.

395
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,699
What?

396
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,139
Hold it!

397
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,299
Is she in there?

398
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,019
Is she in there?
They're busy.

399
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,699
Prime Minister, you are
in great danger!

400
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,019
Stay right where you are.

401
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,779
We're intelligence officers.

402
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,059
You'll have ID, then.

403
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,859
Prime Minister,
step away from Agnes Evans.

404
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,099
Who sent you?

405
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,619
We're from MI6.

406
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,099
Our information is that she
may be armed.

407
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,979
I'm not here to hurt you.

408
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,979
Stop right there!

409
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,499
No more than a minute.

410
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,699
I want your hands in the air and
your MI6 authorisation codes now.

411
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,299
They don't want me talking
to you.

412
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,139
You think this
is why Tony was murdered?

413
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,379
I know it was.

414
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,019
I heard it.

415
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,019
They wanted his phone...and they
wanted these photographs.

416
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,699
He thought whatever was in that
container brought down the plane.

417
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,259
It got damaged. An accident.

418
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,579
He said it was like him.

419
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,739
It fell off the wagon.

420
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,139
Agnes Evans,

421
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,339
I'm arresting you for offences
under the Official Secrets Act.

422
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,179
You do not have to say anything,

423
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,939
but anything that you do say could
be used in evidence against you.

424
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,419
Oh, for Christ's sake,
take it easy!

425
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,699
Prime Minister, if I could
just take...

426
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,699
Prime Minister, if I could
just take...
No, you damn well won't!

427
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,819
So...can you run the story?

428
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,659
Well...

429
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,699
I can.

430
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,739
But...

431
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,739
do these really prove what
he's saying?

432
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,379
Write the story, Ellis.

433
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,379
Tom...

434
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,379
..you're doing the right thing.

435
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,259
You know Felix is muttering
about a vote of no confidence?

436
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,979
At a time like this.

437
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,339
Is he crazy?

438
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,939
Mmm.

439
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,859
What are the Iranians saying?

440
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,179
Well, they deny
any link with Sharour or...

441
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,099
the death of Charles Flyte,
naturally.

442
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,099
But there's evidence out there,
and the press are digging,

443
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,539
here and in the US.

444
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,619
MI6, CIA.

445
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,939
It begins to look pretty compelling.

446
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,899
Yes, well, what I've got's
pretty compelling too.

447
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,899
Mmm. Ellis Kane's going
to be a lone voice on that one.

448
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,139
Still fighting my corner, John?

449
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,099
Mmm.

450
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,059
Go to bed, Tom.

451
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,059
Everyone's waiting
for your decision on Iran.

452
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,459
I think we all agree the future
is what is important.

453
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,499
This country needs companies
like PetroFex and RCB.

454
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,739
Nations and corporations both need
to be run responsibly...

455
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,419
..for the greatest benefit
of the stakeholders

456
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,579
and with leadership...

457
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,259
..equal to the task.

458
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,259
I believe we've secured
the future of our companies.

459
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,659
Now...

460
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,659
we need to do what we can
for our friends in Government.

461
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,019
Sir Michael.

462
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,499
So what's going on?

463
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,019
So how did this get out?

464
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,019
And, Tom, Ellis Kane
was arrested last night.

465
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,419
On what charge?

466
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,459
Offences under
the Terrorism Act.

467
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,659
You're joking!

468
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,179
Possession of material
and photographs.

469
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,099
This is all bullshit.
It's misinformation.

470
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,019
They just want me to go to war.

471
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,459
Does this entire country want
war with Iran?

472
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,059
Is that what they're saying?

473
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,539
That all I have to do is say
the word, and everybody's happy?

474
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,991
Because that would be the easiest
thing in the fucking world!

475
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,159
It's the day of
reckoning for Tom Dawkins

476
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,119
and members of his Government
who are split over his stance on Iran

477
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,119
and its alleged involvement
in the death of Charles Flyte.

478
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,319
So, are you coming in or not?

479
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,999
Pff...Good.

480
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,759
I hope you know what you're doing.

481
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,759
Thank you.

482
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,959
I want Ellis Kane released today.

483
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,279
Now.

484
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,679
'She was in possession of documents.'
Yes, that I gave her.

485
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,079
You want me arrested as well?
It would make life a lot simpler.

486
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,279
Look, Laura,

487
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,799
there's a strong possibility
that your opposite number at MI6

488
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,359
has been sitting
on crucial information

489
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,319
about the death of Charles Flyte
that points away from Iran.

490
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,199
And Ellis Kane has that story.

491
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,319
She's one of the good guys, Laura.

492
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,839
Like you.

493
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,839
And while you're at it, you can
release Agnes Evans as well.

494
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,799
I'd like youbto consider this -

495
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,759
the deadline debacle with PetroFex,

496
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,399
the bandying about of state secrets
during the drone strike,

497
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,239
the allegations of war crimes,

498
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,319
the humbling of our great nation
he brought about

499
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,999
by offering to exchange
emissions for rupees.

500
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,159
And now he's appeasing the Iranians,

501
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,159
despite a clear link
with the murder of Charles Flyte.

502
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,159
Tom!

503
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,959
Tom...
I'm sorry they buried your story.

504
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,879
But there's something else,
there's someone you need to talk to.

505
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,879
I'm afraid I haven't got time
right now.

506
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,119
We're in a hole.

507
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,439
Stop digging. They killed our
fucking Prime Minister. Accept it.

508
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,439
The majority of people in this
country do not want war with Iran.

509
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,759
These are the only numbers
that really matter.

510
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,039
You have a choice.

511
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,599
Come into the chamber now

512
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,199
and announce retaliation
against Iran

513
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,359
or come in there and resign.
And what if I don't?

514
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,959
Well, then, right after the debate
we're coming back in here

515
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,959
and every man jack on that list
will raise his right arm

516
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,679
and throw you out of that window.

517
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,999
Paul Clark's here, sir. I think
you should hear what he has to say.

518
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,039
Do you know why we always
find ourselves

519
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,599
deep in the shit, Tom, you and me?

520
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,759
We just didn't go
to the right schools.

521
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,039
For fuck's sake, Clark.

522
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,359
They're gonna do to you
what they did to me.

523
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,599
They're gonna cut you off
at the knees.

524
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,039
They all want war, you see.
That's your problem.

525
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,279
Gets you out of jail with the banks.

526
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,959
Conflict starts over there,

527
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,159
capital will flee the region
like there's no tomorrow

528
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,719
and this is where it will come.

529
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,639
Our banks will be drinking it up.

530
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,639
And the oil companies, the markets,
the multinationals, the Americans.

531
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,079
Works on just about every level,
wouldn't you say, Felix?

532
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,759
I'd say that if somebody
kills your Prime Minister,

533
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,399
you strike and you strike hard.

534
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,279
Sharour is no terrorist.

535
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,279
The only reason he went to Iran
so many times is cos I sent him.

536
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,439
And that mosque in New York,

537
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,439
he used to drag his nephew
out of there by his ear.

538
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,199
Just thought you'd like to know.

539
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,759
What's the matter, Felix? Facts
don't fit the strategy any longer?

540
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,799
Facts? From Paul Clark?

541
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,839
Ha-ha!

542
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,839
I'll see you in the chamber.

543
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,799
How are you feeling?

544
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,879
You can do this, Tom. Step out of
the shadows and be the man.

545
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,279
You've brought it all within reach.
You want to throw it away now?

546
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,319
Everything you've ever wanted
to achieve standing in the wings

547
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,119
can still be done,
but not if you duck this.

548
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,759
Is that what you think I'm doing?
Ducking?

549
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,879
The principled stand.
The Man In The White Suit.

550
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,639
Talking it up
and never really engaging.

551
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,639
D'you wanna change the world, Tom?

552
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,719
You have to live in it first.

553
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,439
Honourable Members
of this House, the Prime Minister.

554
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,559
The Iranians did not kill
our Prime Minister.

555
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,519
Order! Order!

556
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,519
Let the Prime Minister speak! Order!

557
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,199
PetroFex did.

558
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,519
Order!

559
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,839
Order! Let the Prime Minister speak!

560
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,879
It seems the company
was transporting a sample
of the new drone fuel

561
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,039
in the plane
the Prime Minister was using -

562
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,039
the same drone fuel that we now know
accounted for the ferocity,

563
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,839
though not the onset,
of the explosion at Scarrow

564
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,999
which killed 19 people

565
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,879
and injured 94.

566
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,719
The container was damaged
in an accident

567
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,759
at Houston Airport in Texas

568
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,679
and probably came into contact
with the catalyst in the hold

569
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,679
when the plane passed through
an electrical storm.

570
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,039
Am I certain of this information?

571
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,399
No, I'm not.

572
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,199
Order!

573
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,639
Am I certain that Sami Sharour
blew the plane up,

574
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,759
acting on Iranian instructions?

575
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,039
No, I'm not.

576
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,359
Am I sure that a shadowy coalition

577
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,279
of the markets, the banks,
big business and Americans

578
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,879
will go into meltdown
if peace breaks out?

579
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,959
Again, no, I'm not.

580
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,879
But I put this to you -

581
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,199
are we going to toss away
countless British and Iranian lives

582
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,399
on the strength of information
we're less than sure of?

583
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,199
You tell me.

584
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,439
Because you're going to
have to vote on this.

585
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,439
So let's put ourselves
on the line here for once,

586
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,479
like Agnes Evans did
and Tony Fossett did.

587
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,599
Let's forget party allegiance,
forget vested interests,

588
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,159
forget votes of confidence.

589
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,319
Let each and every one of us
think only of this -

590
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,959
is this war justified?

591
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,319
Hear! Hear!

592
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,719
Is it what the people
of this country want?

593
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,559
Order.

594
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,999
Is it going to achieve
what we want it to achieve?

595
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,439
And if not, then what next?

596
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,559
Order!

597
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,559
Well, I tell you what I think
we should do.

598
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,719
We should represent
the people of this country.

599
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,639
Not the lobby companies
that wine and dine us

600
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,399
or the banks and the big businesses

601
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,359
that tell us
how the world goes round,

602
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,159
not the trade unions
that try and call the shots,

603
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,879
not the civil servants
nor war-mongering generals...

604
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,559
or the security chiefs.

605
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,399
Not the press magnates
and multimillionaire donors

606
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,199
demanding dinner at Number 10.

607
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,199
Not the whips, not the party line,
nor the status quo.

608
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,559
The people of this country,

609
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,559
I put it to you,
do not want another war.

610
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,919
Of that I am sure.

611
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,119
Sure enough to stake
my political career on it.

612
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,439
Order!

613
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,199
Tom, please, enough.

614
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,199
No, John, it's not enough.
It's not nearly enough.

615
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,399
I'll tell you what enough should be.

616
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,319
Enough would be
learning from our past

617
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,319
and not bulldozing our way into
another unwarranted, illegal war.

618
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,559
Hear, hear!

619
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,999
Enough?Order.

620
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,239
I say enough would be
returning democracy to this house

621
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,839
and to the country it represents.

622
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,319
To that end,

623
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,319
I take the unprecedented step...

624
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,959
..of calling for a vote of no
confidence in my own Government.

625
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,759
What the hell's he doing?!

626
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,999
Order.

627
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,999
If you want war with Iran
and you want business as usual,

628
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,239
go ahead.

629
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,599
Vote against me.

630
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,439
But if you are prepared
to take back responsibility

631
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,119
and to take a step
into uncharted territory

632
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,119
for something
that you really care about...

633
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,519
..something that you believe
is right...

634
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,519
..join me and vote
against this Government.

635
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,319
Order! Order!

636
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,199
Order! Order!

637
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,559
Order!

638
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,999
Order!

639
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,959
All right, stand back.

640
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,799
When I first met you,
I didn't think you had it in you.

641
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,439
You know what?

642
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,119
I think maybe you'll do it.

643
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,999
I think maybe you really will.

644
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,959
I don't know.

645
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,599
You get to the top...

646
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,199
..and you realise...

647
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,199
..it's really only the middle.

648
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,399
Come in.

649
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,479
Welcome back, sir.
Thank you.

650
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,199
It was you that brought
those cowboys here!

651
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,199
Your Government!
So what are you gonna do?

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,600
Seen enough?

4
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,760
What are you going to do?

5
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,640
Yeah, you! It was you that brought
those cowboys in. Your government!

6
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,920
So what are you gonna do?

7
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,480
The government I represent
is going to press

8
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,880
for the highest levels
of compensation

9
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,880
for the families of those
who so tragically lost their lives.

10
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
And blow us all to kingdom come!

11
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,880
If everyone shouts at once,
we won't hear

12
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,320
what the Deputy Prime Minister
has to say.

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,360
'..when 19 people were
killed and 94 injured

14
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
'in an explosion at the nearby
PetroFex refinery three d...'

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,200
I want to reassure you that we will
leave no stone unturned.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,360
A team from the HSE are already
at work,

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,400
and the PetroFex company is sending

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,680
specialists from the United
States...

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,000
Can we believe what they tell
us? We want answers!

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,400
We'll have a new government in
a month, and good fucking riddance!

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
It remains to be seen
who will win the election,

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
but the government I represent...

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,840
Oh, shut up!

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,840
We will rebuild here in Scarrow.
You have my word on that.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,240
Your word's worth nothing!
You lot have got it covered!

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,840
Sit down!

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,880
I think we should all,
please, calm down.

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Let him go, Sergeant.

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,840
Mr Dawkins!

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,280
Have you heard of Sollendale?

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,360
I'm sorry?

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,960
Have you heard of Sollendale?
The man beside you might have.

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah, it's one of our plants
in the US.

34
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,680
Four years ago, they came very close
to having an incident

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,280
just like the one they've had here.

36
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
Why weren't we told?

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
If I could just interject...

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,960
The company commissioned a
confidential report and made changes

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,720
to safety procedure at Sollendale,

40
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,920
procedure that was not implemented
here at Scarrow.

41
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,600
Mr Dawkins, would you like to read
that report? I've got a copy here.

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,520
Just a journalist out to cause
trouble.

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,880
I thought we were going
to get lynched in there.

44
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,080
They're angry.
It's understandable.

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,520
They don't get it, do they?
It's all us, this, you know?

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,560
The minibuses, after-school club,
maintenance of the hall.

47
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,080
It's all PetroFex money.

48
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,720
Are you saying they're ungrateful?

49
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,040
No.

50
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,960
No.

51
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,200
Bit of a thankless task.

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,080
Being Deputy Prime Minister
is a succession of thankless tasks.

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,360
Interesting?

54
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,200
Sobering.

55
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,000
I have met with criticism for
attending the summit here in the US

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,600
at such a sensitive time.

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,640
However, the opportunity to press
the case of the people of Scarrow

58
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,520
with Paul Clark and the others
at PetroFex,

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,560
who will ultimately be making
the decisions regarding their
future,

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,080
was one I felt that I had to grasp.

61
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,920
We value the jobs this company
brings to an area

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,360
of considerable economic
deprivation.

63
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,720
But we also demand the very highest
possible safety standards.

64
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,280
It is these issues
that I have raised with Mr Clark

65
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,360
who is as concerned as we are
for the people of Scarrow.

66
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,920
You know, I know Teesside well.
I know the calibre

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,240
of the people there.

68
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,640
And I know that, after a period
of recovery, a period of mourning,

69
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,000
grieving their losses
from this awful tragedy,

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,360
that, er...those communities
will recover.

71
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,240
Make no mistake...

72
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,920
Have you seen Section Four?

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,520
Yes.

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,520
Thanks to Ellis Kane's helpful
Post-its,

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,720
yes, I've seen Section Four.

76
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,400
OK, will do.

77
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Ellis Kane, freelance journalist.

78
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
The Americans want to tap her phone.

79
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,800
The Americans do? Right.

80
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,160
The Americans at MI5
or the Americans at MI6?

81
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,360
Trigger word?

82
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,800
PetroFex.

83
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,200
Just through here.

84
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,320
Thank you.

85
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,080
Deputy Prime Minister.

86
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,200
It's good of you to come.

87
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,680
Thank you.

88
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,760
She was...what age?

89
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Two and a half.

90
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,880
It's strangely peaceful in here.

91
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
It is now.

92
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,280
'The Leader of the
Opposition, Carol Maloy,
claimed today

93
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,840
'that the Prime Minister's
continued absence from the UK

94
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,840
'at a time of national tragedy
serves to underline

95
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,640
'that the government is out
of touch with the people it
is supposed to serve.

96
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,920
'The latest poll figures
add weight to her argument.

97
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,320
'The government is lagging
on average nine points behind
the opposition...'

98
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
The Prime Minister.

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,920
Hello, Charles.

100
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,000
'Tom.'

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Still up in the air?

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,560
'Just about.'

103
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,560
It's a little rough up here,
but we're almost through it now.

104
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
Listen, er, change of plan.
I'm flying straight to Teesside.

105
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,080
I'll be there in about three hours.

106
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,800
'I want you to go to Number 10 in
any case, hold the fort till I get
there.'

107
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
We're on our way.

108
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,440
'Listen, Charles, did you know
there was a similar incident

109
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,720
'at Sollendale four years ago?'

110
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,360
Sollendale is irrelevant, Tom.

111
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,920
'What's important is that'

112
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,080
I've got Clark's word
on a very hefty package

113
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,920
of compensation and reconstruction.

114
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,960
And you have his signature on that,
I presume?

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,080
Listen, I know that you think

116
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,480
'that this trip to the US
was a waste of time...'

117
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,000
I think we're losing the election,
Charles.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
Not many votes in Texas.

119
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,360
'So, the, er...'

120
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,000
compensation package, it...?

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,080
Covers everything, chapter and verse.

122
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,360
Hello? Charles?

123
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,920
Lost him?

124
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
Call him back, will you?

125
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,160
Laura Duchenne.

126
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,200
Ma'am?

127
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,240
Deputy Prime Minister!

128
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,920
Mr Dawkins, is this about Scarrow?

129
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,640
Do they know
what caused the explosion yet?

130
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,160
Is the Prime Minister going
to resign?

131
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
What are your electoral prospects?

132
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,920
Is Charles Flyte going to resign?

133
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,840
All radio and radar contact
has been lost

134
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,920
with the plane carrying
the Prime Minister back from
the United States.

135
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,320
'The last contact was made when
the plane was approximately
900 miles west

136
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,720
'of the British Isles
over the Atlantic.

137
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,840
'Its scheduled arrival time...'

138
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,640
What's he doing out there?

139
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,480
'..was 1.30 this afternoon,
three hours ago.

140
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,520
'There were no distress signals,

141
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,760
'nor have there been any warnings
or claims of responsibility.

142
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,000
'The circumstances are grave,

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,520
'but there remains a possibility

144
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,880
'that the Prime Minister
and the plane's other passengers'

145
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,440
are alive.

146
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,720
That's all I wish to say.

147
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,760
Where was the plane last seen?

148
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,520
So who's running the country,
Mr Dawkins?

149
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:12,215
What the fuck's happened to Charles,
Tom?

150
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:14,055
I wish I knew.

151
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:16,175
Well, you did well.

152
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,175
A military background like yours
comes in handy at times like this,
I suppose.

153
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:24,055
Gents!

154
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:26,575
That's what it says on the door,
Ros.

155
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,255
I wouldn't want to be missing
anything.

156
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:40,775
Well, first off, thanks to Tom
Dawkins for fronting up
so effectively

157
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:44,975
while ministers were dashing back
from far-flung parts.

158
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:49,335
And as Deputy Prime Minister,
Tom is well placed to bring
continuity

159
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,535
while the dust settles.

160
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:53,415
Hear, hear!

161
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:57,415
I'd like to suggest he base himself
here for the time being.

162
00:11:57,415 --> 00:12:02,175
And now I'll pass over to Laura
Duchenne for the security position.

163
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,535
Thank you.

164
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:07,055
All we're looking at - thank you -
is scenarios.

165
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:11,335
The more obvious terrorist angles,
al-Qaeda, dissident Irish
republicans,

166
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:15,055
some sort of double-header
with the Scarrow explosion.

167
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:16,935
But there wasn't a bomb at Scarrow?

168
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:19,935
We can't be certain yet,
but we don't think so.

169
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:21,935
However, it was an unscheduled
flight,

170
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:23,135
and the fact that so few...

171
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:24,415
Whose plane was he on?

172
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:26,415
It was a PetroFex plane.

173
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,895
As I say, so few people knowing
the PM was returning that way,

174
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:40,335
renders an attack less likely,
but don't rule it out.

175
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,975
We still don't know
if there was an incident.

176
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:45,255
I think it's going to be all right.

177
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:47,815
So you think he's still flying
around up there, Felix?

178
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:51,975
I wish he was. Which is more
than can be said for you, Ros.

179
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:57,175
'Details remain thin on the ground

180
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:59,575

182
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,775
Toothpaste, toothbrush,
flannel, towels, soap.

183
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,695
Oh, thank you.

184
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:09,655
And ear plugs?

185
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,975
In the drawer beside the bed.

186
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,255
Thank you.

'..earlier today
but remains at Number 10.'

190
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,255
No. No, thank you. It's... It's OK.

191
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:24,935
I have been praying for him.

192
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:28,615
I'm going to pray for you too.

193
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,895
'Captain Dawkins, come in, over.'

194
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:59,215
Sir, um...
I'm sorry to wake you so early.

195
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:05,455
We've had a call.

196
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,775
They've found wreckage.

197
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,335
Thank you.

198
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:25,215
He's dead. Nothing we do
is going to change that.

199
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:29,735
We'd have had to replace him
after he lost us the election
anyhow.

200
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,135
I need to know what my
approval numbers are. Exactly.

201
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:37,575
So who else is saying yes?

202
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:42,255
I've got a lot of support.
I'll have a hell of a lot more

203
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:45,415
if I can say
that Tom Dawkins will be my DPM.

204
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:51,055
Ros, Felix,
we need a show of solidarity.

205
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:53,895
A coronation. I couldn't agree more.

206
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:56,815
Just need a credible coronee!

207
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,615
Well, you two will have
to wrestle with that.

208
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:03,535
I suggest that as a neutral,
Tom hangs on to the reins.

209
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,575
In the meantime.

210
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:22,455
I know what you were doing, John.

211
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:32,895
There's a party to lead
and a country to run,

212
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:36,095
and when it comes right down to it,
it's me or Fauntleroy.

213
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:38,335
Think about it -
a country run by Felix.

214
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,055
Ros, this isn't the time.

215
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,415
I'm offering you the deputyship.

216
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,295
Do we have a deal?

217
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:48,455
Do I have a choice?

218
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,655
Good luck.

219
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:26,455
It is with great sadness
that I have to inform you

220
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:30,375
that wreckage retrieved from the
north Atlantic early this morning

221
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,255
has now been identified
as coming from the plane

222
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:35,615
carrying our nation's
Prime Minister.

223
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,055
'The government is therefore
regretfully adopting an official
position -

224
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:44,095

225
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,975

within the next week

226
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:52,095

the election.

227
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:58,255

when I say that as a man
and a leader,'

228
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:00,255
he will be greatly missed.

229
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:04,495
Coming as this does...

230
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:22,475
Tragically, this comes in the wake
of the disaster in Scarrow.

231
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:29,395
And on the back of...a good few
years now of real hardship

232
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,915
for a lot of people in this country.

233
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:37,395
And you might feel, as I do...

234
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,835
..that our nation
is being sorely tested.

235
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,395
It is.

236
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:46,035
It is.

237
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:52,315
But a tragedy like this
can act to bring us together...

238
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:57,595
..despite political differences
and economic strife.

239
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:00,275
I have a powerful belief

240
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:04,995
that all those who live in this
great nation of ours can play a part

241
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:08,075
as we pick our way
through our current troubles,

242
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:11,955
and that even in the midst
of tragedy, we must have faith

243
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:14,195
that there is a better path ahead.

244
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:18,275
Charles Flyte may be dead,

245
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:22,635
but that idea of faith and hope
must endure.

246
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:28,155
Our thoughts are with his wife
and with his family.

247
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:29,955
Thank you.

248
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:31,915

Mr Dawkins? Mr Dawkins?

292
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,435
Your boss got nothing
out of that meeting with PetroFex.

293
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:56,635
I've seen the minutes.

294
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,075
You've got my number.

Get hold of her file.

296
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:24,126
That's you, sir.

00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:29,926
Taking time out of your busy schedule
to meet me? I'm honoured.

Thanks.

299
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,806
So, Miss Kane...

300
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:37,566
Look Sharp.

301
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:40,286
That's what he calls himself.

302
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:44,086
It's how he starts his emails. Look
Sharp. My inside man at PetroFex.

303
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:50,446
'And he has the minutes
of the meetings between Charles'

and Paul Clark?

305
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:53,406

306
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,406
And in return?

307
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:03,646
You have a man inside Number 10.
What more do you want?

308
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:05,286
I don't know if you read the papers,

309
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:09,086
but your lot are not going to be
in Number 10 for much longer.

310
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:10,566
So why give them to me?

311
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:13,526
I could write the story -
I probably will - but right now,

312
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:15,726
you could actually do something.

313
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:32,166
'Pass him over to me.'

314
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,366
Yes, ma'am.

315

Hello?

317
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:41,806
Tom, will you please, for Christ's
sake, get off the street?

318
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:43,486
'Keeping tabs on me, Laura?'

319

00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,926
he'd been downloading
structural diagrams

321
00:22:53,926 --> 00:22:56,086
of the plane Charles
was killed in.

322
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:15,806
'Sorry about Charles.
He was a good man.'

323
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:19,526
He had a great future ahead of
him. I was very fond of him.

324
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:21,806
'Yes, I'm sure you were fond
of him.'

325
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:26,086
Look, I've just been going
through the minutes of your
meeting together.

326
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:28,206
'What minutes?'

327
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:32,206
Well, one of Charles's
assistants emailed them through
before they left.

328
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:35,926
Charles's assistants
weren't in the meeting, Tom.

329
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:39,366
'Well, the point is, I spoke to
Charles when he was halfway back'

330
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:42,846
and what he told me,
and the minutes don't,

331
00:23:42,846 --> 00:23:47,126
is that you and he agreed on a hefty
compensation package for Scarrow.

332
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:51,366
We know what
our responsibilities are, Tom.

333
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:54,446
'With all due respect,
that's not the impression
you're giving.'

334
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,006
We need you over here.

335
00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:59,806
We need you looking at
the devastation on Teesside

336
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:02,446
and telling us
what you're going to do about it.

337
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:07,006
I've seen devastation before, Tom.
I saw the place before we set up
there.

338
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:09,286
'I see that you're quoted in
the press as saying'

339
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:12,446
that an American life
is more valuable than a British one.

340
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:15,806
That's not a moral statement,
that's an actuarial one.

341
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:18,206
Yes, but you set your safety
standards accordingly.

342
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,686
'I've seen the Sollendale report.'

343
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:24,286
Why don't we just row back
a little bit here?

344
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:27,766
Why don't we row back to where
you deliver what you promised?

345
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:32,766
You know, I think I'll wait
till after the election.

346
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:34,886
I wouldn't want to be wasting
my breath.

347
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:17,086
What is it, John?

348
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:22,566
Between you and me and the gatepost,
I've had a little private poll
conducted.

349
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:24,526
Oh, yes?

350
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:27,446
And when asked who they would like
to see as Prime Minister,

351
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:31,206
given the choice of you,
Ros Yelland or Felix...

352
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:32,926
They said Wayne Rooney.

353
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:38,526
56% of them said you.

354
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:45,446
You give off stability, Tom,
and people are craving that.

355
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:52,766
No.

356
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:57,006
Ros Yelland is...
the best man for the job.

357
00:25:57,006 --> 00:25:59,006
The public don't agree.

358
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:00,926
She's not simpatico.

359
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,046
Do you really want to be in
opposition for the next five years?

360
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:08,646
I'm not a leader.

361
00:26:09,646 --> 00:26:12,646
You looked very like one
making that speech the other day.

362
00:26:12,646 --> 00:26:16,166
You were a captain in the army
for ten years.

363
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:20,286
That's where I learned my lesson.

364
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,046
Then you're a different man now.

365
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:30,126
And you know it. Now, look me in
the eye and tell me it isn't true.

366
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:35,126
She wants me to be her deputy.

367
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:40,046
Tom, we need someone with balls.

368
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:45,166
As DPM to Ros Yelland, you're
like the sultan's fucking eunuch!

369
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:49,206
Come on!

370
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,646
Dignity in death!
Dignity in death!

371
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:16,886
Let us bury our dead!

372
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,806
Could you hold on one moment?

373
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:26,046
Tom, you met with a pathologist
when you were in Scarrow.
Mark Ashcroft?

374
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:29,486
He's called us in the press room
half a dozen times trying
to reach you.

375
00:27:31,846 --> 00:27:34,566
Dr Ashcroft. Briefly, please.

376
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:38,286
Nisa Matthews, the little girl
whose hand you found.

377
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:42,646
There are toxicity readings in her
soft tissue that I wouldn't expect
to find.

378
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:45,286
Her and all of the blast victims.

379
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:48,126
What sort of toxicity readings?

380
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:51,566
'Her father's the same, but much more
pronounced. He's awash with it.'

381
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:54,366
I want to make sure
that it's not a genetic anomaly,

382
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:56,806
so I need to keep hold
of both of their bodies.

383
00:27:56,806 --> 00:28:00,926
Surely, by now, you must have
completed your investigat...

384
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:03,726
'Her dad, Dermot Matthews,
worked at the plant.

385
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:06,926
'So I've been asking what he might
have come into contact with.

386
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:09,686
'The company have been fighting me
every inch of the way.

387
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:12,686
'They even tried to deny
that the body was his at first.

388
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:14,686
'Said he wasn't on site at the time.

389
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:18,806
'The mother's told the press
I'm keeping the bodies for no reason.

390
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:21,446
'I'm under siege, just because
I'm trying to do my job.'

391
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:24,646
D-D-Dr Ashcroft,
we're talking about a woman

392
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:27,366
who's lost her husband
and her daughter.

393
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:30,326
Mrs Matthews just wants the bodies
of her loved ones back.

394
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:32,446
And she will get them.

395
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:35,166
Just as soon as PetroFex
give me the information

396
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,486
that I need to complete
the postmortems.

397
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:38,806
Yes.

398
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:41,246
Well, thank you for calling, Doctor.

399
00:28:57,686 --> 00:28:59,486
Hello?

400
00:29:01,446 --> 00:29:05,686
Who is this?

401
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:25,846
Bless my soul,
it's the father of the nation.

402
00:29:27,606 --> 00:29:30,446
Well, very statesman-like.

403
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:31,926
Tony Fossett.

404
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:41,646
Him?

405
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,206
Yes.

406
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:44,966
And, er...her?

407
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:46,126
Yes.

408
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:48,766
And him.

409
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:50,406
No.

410
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:52,046
You just haven't met him yet.

411
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:57,086
Er... As you were.

412
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,086
All right, stand down.

413
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:00,566
You never lose it.

414
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,246
So how are you, Tony?

415
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:06,646
Could you actually lend me 20?
I've got a cabbie waiting outside.

416
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,406
Taxi's got an oily chain, has it?

417
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:14,046
I've been to see my sister.

418
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,766
You remember her.

419
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:17,806
You shagged her once.

420
00:30:18,806 --> 00:30:23,326
Me? I was blameless. I took the sofa
because she wanted the spare room.

421
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:24,806
And why were you on my sofa?

422
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:27,566
You know bloody well
why I was on the sofa.

423
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:33,286
You compounded your misdemeanour
on my sofa with my sister.

424
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:35,486
And now look at you.

425
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:38,766
I miss those days.

426
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:43,606
Pass me your phone, would you?

427
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:50,806
Do you mind if I take the battery
out?

428
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:53,246
You can never be too careful.

429
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:57,086
Nobody's bugging me, Tony.

430
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:58,126
Maybe.

431
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:02,366
As long as you have a battery
in your phone,

432
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:04,686
they can drop in whenever they like.

433
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:06,886
Humour him. We do.

434
00:31:09,806 --> 00:31:12,446
I need your help, Tony.

435
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:15,326
I'm getting nothing from
Laura Duchenne.

436
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:17,206
No help with PetroFex.

437
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:21,926
The mighty Laura Duchenne was
a lowly reports officer when
I was at MI5.

438
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:26,926
She always did have her own agenda
and now she's running the place.

439
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,606
She could never live with the idea
that I knew she'd cocked up on
Nightlight.

440
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:35,446
'I had a call from the pathologist.

441
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:39,686
'There were toxins at Scarrow
they can't explain.

442
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:44,366
'Now PetroFex are obstructing
his investigation. So I need to know

443
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:46,486
'what they're hiding.'

444
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:51,926
Charles told me that they were going
to pay out big compensation.

445
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:55,326
They've gone very quiet
on that front.

446
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:59,686
You'll have to show them
what you're made of, Tom.

447
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,855
Cover the road.

448
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,415
They're telling me I'll have
to quit if I become PM.

449
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:13,615
You won't have time to smoke
when you're PM.

450
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:17,215
You see, the ridiculous thing is...

451
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,975
..having to do all this without
looking like we're actually trying.

452
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:27,735
There's a sense of it being unseemly
with Charles sort of...out there.

453
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:32,295
Look, I know Ros has you
on an exclusive, Tom,

454
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:34,895
but, um, it's a lost cause,
believe me.

455
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:40,015
Say the word and I'll wrap you
in my warm and tender love.

456
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:41,655
Foreign Secretary?

457
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:45,895
That'd give her something
to think about on the back benches.

458
00:32:47,535 --> 00:32:49,935
We can hide in here for five minutes.

459
00:32:55,135 --> 00:32:58,255
Clark's been trying to wriggle out
of the compensation package

460
00:32:58,255 --> 00:32:59,975
that he agreed with Charles.

461
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:02,735
You haven't been frightening
the horses, have you, Tom?

462
00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:04,895
Clark's a slippery sod.

463
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:08,895
Yes, but don't worry about Clark.
We have mutual friends.

464
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:15,375
I've heard that you've been putting
it about that they killed Charles.

465
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,575
PetroFex.

466
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:18,335
You heard wrong.

467
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:24,535
Cos you're aware how flaky
that would sound in the public arena?

468
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,455
You're swimming against the tide,
Tom.

469
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:29,575
The company's share price
actually rose today.

470
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:32,415
And who's the company's
biggest shareholder, Felix?

471
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:34,735
Royal Caledonian Bank.

472
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:36,975
Royal Caledonian Bank.

473
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,775
And who owns the bank?

474
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:42,255
Oh, Tom, look...

475
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:43,215
We do.

476
00:33:43,215 --> 00:33:47,855
The British Government. The British
people. And the bank owns PetroFex.

477
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:53,015
Are you trying
to write my manifesto for me?

478
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:59,735
I just want to know
that you'll be on the case, Felix,

479
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:02,215
if we win the election
with you as leader.

480
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:13,575
'I have
nothing to say to you, all right?

481
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:16,855
'I have nothing to say to you,
all right?'

482
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:19,975
'I have nothing to say to you,
all right?'

483
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:24,175
He's a mix of Manc and Mackem.

484
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:32,175
Formative years in Didsbury and then
a good 20-odd in Sunderland.

485
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:34,815
'I have nothing to say to you,
all right?'

486
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:36,535
'I've nothing to say to you,
all right?'

487
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:39,375
'This is Dr Ashcroft, Pathologist.

488
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:43,535
'I'm not at my desk. I need the
test results again for the
Matthews family.'

489
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:47,975
How's that, Nightlight? Good?
Where's the phone?

490
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:55,535
What were you doing in Fauntleroy's
camp, Tom? Not putting out
for favours, I hope.

491
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:58,055
Oh, just keeping abreast
of developments.

492
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,535
What's the latest?
Tax relief on gun dogs?

493
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:04,135
You're not going to beat him, Ros.

494
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,735
Tom?

495
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:11,055
If you're saying you're standing,
I'll break your fucking nose.

496
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:14,935
We were a team.

497
00:35:14,935 --> 00:35:18,935
I asked if you were standing. You
said no. I said, "Come with me."

498
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:22,175
Look at the polls, Ros.

499
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:24,575
Fuck the polls!

500
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:29,295
I haven't even started, and you'd
better not get in my way, Tom.

501
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:38,415
'Hello. Colton Laboratory.'

502
00:35:38,415 --> 00:35:42,495
Er, this is Dr Ashcroft,
Pathology. I'm not at my desk.

503
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:46,015
I need the test results again
for the Matthews family.

504
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:51,855
About your request for promotion.

505
00:35:51,855 --> 00:35:54,895
I've been told to tell you
not to hold your breath.

506
00:35:54,895 --> 00:35:56,375
There's a surprise!

507
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,815
Economic climate, etc, etc.

508
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:02,895
Hey, want to see something
above your pay grade?

509
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:06,295
Have you heard of Syed Khan?

510
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:12,215
There we go.

511
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:13,255
What's this?

512
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,215
Photos we intercepted
from his phone.

513
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:20,615
The last photos of the PM alive.

514
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:24,335
Sent by Syed to his cousin
before they took off.

515
00:36:28,415 --> 00:36:31,375
The same cousin who's just been
arrested.

516
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:36,575
'Hello?'

517
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:39,575
Can you put me through
to Tom Dawkins, please?

518
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:42,095
'I'm sorry, the Deputy Prime Minister
is not available.'

519
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:43,175
And you are who?

520
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:45,735
'I'm Mr Dawkins' Private Secretary.'

521
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,855
So he's got time to tell you
to tell me

522
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:49,615
'he hasn't got time to talk to me,

523
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:52,655
'but not enough time
to tell me that himself?

524
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:55,455
'You know he once shagged
my sister?'

525
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:58,975
No, I didn't know that, sir.
Shall I, um...?

526
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:01,375
'Not many people do.'

527
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:05,295
He wasn't always
the paragon of virtue he is now.

528
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:07,415
Ask his ex-wife.

529
00:37:07,415 --> 00:37:11,055
'She knows
where all the bodies are buried.'

530
00:37:12,015 --> 00:37:15,175
Nice talking to you, Mr Fossett.
Anything you'd like me to pass on?

531
00:37:15,175 --> 00:37:21,015
Um... Could you tell him to go fuck
himself with a feather duster?

532
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:23,495
Right. Goodbye, Mr Fossett.

533
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:24,375
'Tell him to call...'

534
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:30,655
Tell him he needs to hear more
about toxicology.

535
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:57,695
'Police are investigating
the death of Scarrow pathologist
Mark Ashcroft,

536
00:38:57,695 --> 00:39:00,215
'whose body was found this evening.

537
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:04,335
'Meanwhile, the survivors of Scarrow
say the government has abandoned
them.

538
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:06,495
'Work has yet to resume
at the refinery,

539
00:39:06,495 --> 00:39:08,775
'and no government minister has
visited the town since...'

540
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:28,935
You're thinking about Bosnia.

541
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,695
Yes.

542
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:38,255
Tom...

543
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:43,135
..you did the right thing.

544
00:39:43,135 --> 00:39:44,735
Did I?

545
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:58,575
Well...

546
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:01,575
What if I stand?

547
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:06,055
Don't, Tom.

548
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:13,135
'Westminster is alive
with speculation today

549
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:15,295
'as the government decides
on a new leader

550
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:17,735
'to take them forward
into the General Election.'

551
00:40:33,455 --> 00:40:35,455
Good luck, sir.

552
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:46,775
The dark patches are burn marks -
in all probability, a bomb.

553
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,855
Is it true you spoke to
the pathologist the day he died?

554
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:54,255
There was mention of a substance -
PFX44.

555
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:57,375
Al-Qaeda claimed it
pretty early on.

556
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:00,055
If we're going to get a shot at them,
it'll have to be now.

557
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:01,575
I'm going to ask you to stop right
there.

558
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:02,615
You don't suppose they'll shoot us,
do you?

559
00:41:02,615 --> 00:41:05,415
You can never tell
with the Americans, sir.

560
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:07,895
They won't spike Tony Fossett
because he's an intramural subject.

561
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:09,775
Meaning?

562
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:13,815
A bad influence, am I? Is that it?
Know too much about you, do I?

563
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:15,415
It's personal.

564
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:19,855
Don't say my name.
I was hoping we could...have a talk.

565
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:22,695
Just need to get our angles, right.
And get the word from you?

566
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:24,175
This may be our one shot.

567
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:26,695
They're praying.

568
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,215
Then, we've got him!

569
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:29,775
You can't kill a man who's praying!

570
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:32,095
Is this you? Bosnia, 1992?

571
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:36,575
And when he comes a cropper,
I want people to say,
"Remember what Ros Yelland said."

572
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:38,495
They're on the move.
This is our last chance.

573
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:39,615
Tom!

574
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:04,375

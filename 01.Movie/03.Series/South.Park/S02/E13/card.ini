[storyline]
orig = South Park is holding its annual Cow Days festival, and has commemorated the event with an enormous cow clock. When the cows see the clock, however, they become entranced by it, and begin worshiping it as the cow messiah. Meanwhile at the Cow Days carnival, the boys find a game booth with Terrance and Phillip dolls as prizes. They make a plan to have Cartman win the bull-riding contest so they can use the prize money to win the dolls. During training, however, Cartmen takes a blow to the head and wakes up slightly different than he was before.

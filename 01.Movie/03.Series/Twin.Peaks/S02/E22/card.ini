[storyline]
orig = In the cliff-hanging series finale, Cooper must face his innermost fears as he tracks down Windom Earle, who has abducted Annie and taken her into the hellish realm of the Black Lodge. Meanwhile, Nadine, wounded by a hit on the head during the beauty pageant, wakes up now back to her old self, and becomes very upset when she sees Big Ed with Norma. Donna struggles to control herself from Ben Horne's news, which leads to a fistfight between him and Dr. Hayward who angrily knocks Ben into a fireplace mantle for interfering with his family, and apparently killing him. While Truman and Andy wait and wait for Cooper to return from the Black Lodge, Andrew and Pete steal the safety deposit box key and go to the Twin Peaks Savings and Loan where Audrey is staging a feeble act of civil disobedience. But when Andrew and Pete open Thomas Eckhardt's final box, they instead find a bomb - which explodes. Major Briggs receives a cryptic message from Windom Earle in the Black Lodge through the conduit of Sarah Palmer.

[storyline]
orig = Michael, being Michael Scott, overreacts to an 'injury' he has. This steers everyone away from realising that Dwight is the one with a more serious injury. No matter how ill or injured you are though, if you call shotgun, you get the front seat, no matter what...at least according to Michael.

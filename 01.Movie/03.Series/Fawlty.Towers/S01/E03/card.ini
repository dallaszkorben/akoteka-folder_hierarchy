[storyline]
orig = Basil Fawlty's puritanical streak comes out when a young couple he suspects of not being married tries to book a double room. He's ready to give them rooms on separate floors until Sybil steps in. It turns out that the couple know Polly but when he sees her coming out of their room - she was trying on a dress her friend had brought her for the wedding they would be attending - Basil begins to think everyone has gone mad. All that's left is for another guest, Mrs. Peignoir, to get tipsy and make a pass at him. For Manuel, it's his birthday and a night of celebrating takes its toll.
